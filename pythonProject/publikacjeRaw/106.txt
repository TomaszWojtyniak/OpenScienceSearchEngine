The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft performed the first composition measurements of Titan’s ionosphere. INMS revealed that Titan has the most compositionally complex ionosphere in the Solar System, with roughly 50 ions at or above the detection threshold. Modeling of the ionospheric composition constrains the density of minor neutral constituents, most of which cannot be measured with any other technique. The species identified with this approach include the most complex molecules identified so far on Titan. This confirms the long-thought idea that a very rich chemistry is actually taking place in this atmosphere. However, it appears that much of the interesting chemistry occurs in the upper atmosphere rather than at lower altitudes. The species observed by INMS are probably the first inter- mediates in the formation of even larger molecules. As a consequence, they affect the composition of the bulk atmosphere, the composition and optical properties of the aerosols and the flux of condensable material to the surface. In this paper, we discuss the production and loss reactions for the ions and how this affects the neutral densities. We compare our results to neutral densities measured in the stratosphere by other instruments, to production yields obtained in laboratory experiments simulating Titan’s chemistry and to predictions of photochemical models. We suggest neutral formation mechanisms and highlight needs for new experimental and theoretical data. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The pressure ranges from 1.5 bar at the surface to 10−12 bar at 1400 km and the temperature from 70 K at the tropopause to 200 K at the stratopause (Vinatier et al., 2007). Its principal constituents are N2, a few percent of CH4 and few tenths of a percent of H2. Minor constituents include hydrocarbons and nitriles created by photochemistry from N2 and CH4. The most abundant, C2H4, C2H2, HCN and C2H6, have a mole fraction of a few 10−6 in the stratosphere (Vinatier et al., 2007). They result from the action on N2 and CH4 of high-energy electrons from Saturn’s magnetosphere and UV photons from solar radiation. CH4 is dissociated throughout the atmosphere, directly at higher altitudes and indirectly in the * Corresponding author. Fax: +1 (520) 621 4933. E-mail address: vvuitton@lpl.arizona.edu (V.

However, dissociation of N2 requires energetic electrons or photons that are deposited predominantly above ∼1000 km. It follows that formation of nitrogen-bearing molecules predominantly occurs in the upper atmosphere (Lara et al., 1996; Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004; Yung et al., 1984). Performing an inventory of the simpler molecules in their production region is crucial since they quickly react as they diffuse down to lower altitudes. Nitro- gen can be linked to carbon at various degrees of saturation (ni- triles, imines, amines) and this determines its availability for in- corporation into more complex molecules. Complex N-bearing species are precursors for the creation of haze particles and can condense in the lower stratosphere (Lebonnois et al., 2002; Wilson and Atreya, 2003). Aerosols will ultimately accumulate on the surface, modifying its appearance and composition. De- termination of the upper atmosphere composition is then neces- sary for an understanding of nitrogen chemistry at all levels of the atmosphere. http://www.elsevier.com/locate/icarus mailto:vvuitton@lpl.arizona.edu http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2007.06.023 N-containing molecules in Titan’s upper atmosphere 723 Fig. 1. INMS measurements and the Keller et al. (1998) model. The black dots show the INMS mass spectrum measured on April 16, 2005 (T5 flyby), averaged between the altitudes of 1027 and 1200 km, and the dashed line connects the points. Error bars are included with the points but are smaller than the symbol size for larger densities. They represent the uncertainty due to counting statistics and a systematic error of ∼20% due to calibration uncertainties. The plain line shows the model of Keller et al. (1998) scaled to match the data at m/z = 28. The mass spectrum was computed for an altitude of 1055 km using the Yung (1987) atmospheric model. Keller et al. (1992, 1998) developed a comprehensive one- dimensional photochemical model to study both the com- position and density structure of Titan’s ionosphere. Their background neutral atmosphere is taken from the models developed by Toublanc et al. (1995), Yung et al. (1984) and Yung (1987). Photoionization by solar EUV and elec- tron impact ionization by photoelectrons and saturnian mag- netospheric electrons are both included. The major neutral species (nitrogen and methane) are ionized to produce N2 +, N+, CH4+, CH3+, CH2+, and CH+ ions. Ion–neutral chem- istry converts these ions to higher mass products. The major species at the ionospheric peak (at an altitude of 1050 km) are found to be mostly hydrocarbon ions, such as C2H5 +, c-C3H3 +, C3H5+, and C5H5+. The only N-containing species are HCNH+ the most abundant ion, HC3NH+ and C4H5NH+. Water ion species do not reach a significant amount. Other mod- els (Banaszkiewicz et al., 2000; Fox and Yelle, 1997; Ip, 1990; Wilson and Atreya, 2004), despite all differences in chemical networks and energy deposition processes, obtain mostly simi- lar results. The Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft obtained measurements of Titan’s iono- spheric composition during the egress of the T5 encounter on 16 April, 2005. At closest approach the spacecraft was at an al- titude of 1027 km, a latitude of 74◦ N, and a local time of 23:15. The solar zenith angle at this location is 127◦ and the encounter occurred in darkness. Fig. 1 shows the average ion spectrum in the 1027–1200 km region measured by INMS. The mass spec- trum of Titan’s ionosphere is quite complex. There are 45 peaks between m/z = 1 and 99, with a mass periodicity of 12 amu. The detection threshold is roughly 0.3 cm−3. A computed spec- trum of Titan’s ionosphere at an altitude of 1055 km based on the Keller et al. (1998) model is compared to the INMS data in Fig. 1. Although for many mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) the ion densities are reproduced remarkably well, the measurements show a richer composition than predicted by the model. Most of the even masses are missing. Titan’s ionospheric chemistry is simple in principle. As in any reducing environment, ionization flows from species whose parent neutrals have smaller proton affinities (PA) to species whose parent neutrals have larger PA (Fox and Yelle, 1997). It follows that the ionospheric composition is a function of the neutral composition weighted by the PA of these neutrals. Be- cause proton exchange reactions drive the chemistry, the most abundant ions are essentially protonated neutrals (closed-shell ions). Radical cations (C2H4 +, C3H4+, NH3+, HCN+) have a low abundance because they are difficult to produce and are lost quickly through reactions with the main neutral species. Because the atomic mass of a carbon atom is 12 amu and it has 4 valence electrons, closed-shell hydrocarbons always have an even mass. Because the atomic mass of a nitrogen atom is 14 amu and it has 5 valence electrons, closed-shell molecules containing carbon, hydrogen and a single nitrogen atom always have an odd mass. It follows that protonated closed-shell hy- drocarbon ions have odd masses (CxHy + H+, where y is an even integer), while ions containing a single N atom have even masses (CxHyN + H+, where y is an odd integer). Thus, iden- tifying the ions in the INMS spectra is straightforward: ions at odd values of m/z are likely protonated hydrocarbon mole- cules, ions at even values of m/z are likely protonated nitriles. With this approach, Vuitton et al. (2006a) identified the pre- viously non-attributed ions at m/z = 18, 30, 42, 54, and 56 as NH4 +, CH2NH2+, CH3CNH+, C2H3CNH+, and C2H5CNH+, respectively. Moreover, by coupling a simple chemical model with the measured densities of ions (m/z < 60), they deter- mined the abundance of nine neutral species, four of them not having previously been observed on Titan. In the following, we extend the study by Vuitton et al. (2006a) to the heavier mass end of the INMS spectrum (m/z > 60). We use the same model as Vuitton et al. (2006a), 724 V. Vuitton et al. / Icarus 191 (2007) 722–742 but extend the chemical reactions list to estimate neutral mole fractions at 1100 km for 9 new species. We discuss in more de- tail the production and loss reactions for the ions and how this affects the neutral densities. We compare our results to neutral densities measured in the stratosphere by other instruments, to production yields obtained in laboratory experiments sim- ulating Titan’s chemistry and to predictions of photochemical models. We suggest neutral formation mechanisms and high- light needs for new experimental or theoretical data. In Section 2 we describe the photochemical model in detail. Section 3 focuses on ion production and loss mechanisms and neutral mole fractions. Section 4 presents and discusses com- parisons with other observational, experimental and theoretical datasets. Conclusions are given in Section 5. 2. Theoretical model 2.1. Model description The model adopts atmospheric conditions appropriate for the 1100 km level and assumes local chemical equilibrium. At this altitude, reaction rates are rapid and diffusion is unim- portant by comparison. The chemical lifetime is given by (kNn) −1, where k is the ion–molecule reaction rate constant and Nn the density of reactive neutrals. A typical value for k is 10−9 cm−3 s−1 and at 1100 km, the density of reactive neutrals is roughly 5 × 105 cm−3, leading to a chemical time constant of 2 × 103 s. The diffusion time constant is given by H 2/D, where H is the atmospheric scale height and D the diffusion coefficient. Adopting H = 75 km and D = 109 cm2 s−1 im- plies a diffusion time constant of 5 × 104 s, significantly longer than the chemical time constant. The model solves the continuity equation for the ith ion species as (1) dNi dt = Pi − LiNi, where Ni is the density of ion species i (cm −3), and Pi and Li (cm−3 s−1) the chemical production and loss rate, respectively. The production rate Pi is defined as (2)Pi = ∑ n σnNn + ∑ i′n Φi′nki′nNi′Nn, where Ni′ and Nn are the densities of other ion species i ′ and neutral species n (cm−3), σn is the ionization rate of neu- tral species n (s−1), Φi′n is the branching ratio of the channel leading to species i and ki′n is the ion–molecule rate constant (cm3 s−1) for the reaction between species i′ and n. The loss rate Li is defined as (3)Li = αiNeNi + ∑ n kinNiNn, where Ne is the electron density, αi is the electron recombi- nation coefficient for species i (cm3 s−1), and kin the ion– molecule rate constant (cm3 s−1) for the reaction between species i and n. We solve Eq. (1) by integrating to a steady state (dNi/dt = 0). Neutral densities Nn are held fixed with time. We advance from one time step to the next by solving the equation with a fully implicit Newton–Raphson technique. Cal- culations are run until production and loss terms are balanced to better than 1 part per million. The INMS spectra show clear signs of isotopic signatures at high m/z where the abundance of isotopic molecules is en- hanced by the large number of atoms. Isotopes vary little in mass from the most abundant species. The difference in rate coefficient is usually within the experimental error. This is not true however, with isomeric species, which can have very differ- ent rate coefficients and products: e.g., C3H3 +. Unfortunately, reaction rate data on most isotopic molecules is lacking. There- fore, to include the effect of isotopes we assume that the reac- tion rates for isotopic molecules are the same as for the main isotope. We adopt values of H/D = 4350, 12C/13C = 82.3, and 14N/15N = 183 based on INMS and GC–MS measure- ments of isotope ratios in the neutral gas (Niemann et al., 2005; Waite et al., 2005). 2.2. Atmospheric background As indicated by Eqs. (2) and (3), ion densities depend closely upon the composition of the neutral atmosphere. During T5, INMS ion measurements were interspersed with neutral mea- surements, so the main atmospheric constituents, N2, CH4 and H2, are well characterized. Their mole fraction at 1100 km are 9.7×10−1,2.7×10−2 and 4.0×10−3, respectively. Other neu- tral species measured by INMS include C2H2, C2H6, C3H4 and C3H8 (Waite et al., 2005). Their mole fractions for T5 appear to be similar to TA (Cui et al., in preparation). The mole fractions of these neutrals are held fixed in the model and are listed in Table 1. Other minor species have not yet been accurately con- strained by INMS neutral measurements, either because their signature is masked by more abundant constituents (C2H4), because of possible adsorption on the walls of the instrument (radicals, C4H2, HCN, etc.), or because their density is below the detection limit. H, N and NH are fixed at values calcu- lated in the Wilson and Atreya (2004) photochemical model. Most heavy hydrocarbons and N-containing species are best constrained by measurement of the protonated species and their densities are tuned to produce the observed ion densities. The ambient electron temperature was taken as 718 K, consistent with the value measured by the Cassini Radio Plasma Wave Spectrometer (RPWS) during the T5 encounter (Wahlund, per- sonal communication). 2.3. Ionization mechanisms Electron impact ionization of minor neutrals is slow in comparison with ion–molecule reaction rates and ionization of species other than N2 and CH4 is neglected. Adopting a photoionization cross-section of 5 × 10−16 cm2 implies a pho- toionization time constant of 2 × 109 s, much longer than the chemical time constant of 2×103 s. For N2 and CH4 we use the electron impact ionization cross sections of Orient and Srivas- tava (1987) and Rapp and Englander-Golden (1965), a mean suprathermal electron energy of 100 eV (Szego et al., 2005), N-containing molecules in Titan’s upper atmosphere 725 Table 1 Neutral mole fractions in Titan’s atmosphere at 1100 and 300 km. The mole fractions of the species in italic are determined in this work from INMS neutral measurements obtained on the Cassini T5 flyby at 74◦ N and 1100 km. Proton affinity (Hunter and Lias, 1998) and detection in the interstellar and circumstel- lar medium (http://www.astrochymist.org/astrochymist_ism.html) are listed as well.

A net ionization rate of 1 cm−3 s−1 pro- duces good agreement between the model and INMS measure- ments of ion density. An ionization rate of 1 cm−3 s−1 implies a suprathermal electron flux of 1.2 × 106 cm−2 s−1 for an elec- tron energy of 100 eV, a mean electron impact cross section of 4 × 10−16 cm2, and a neutral density of 2 × 109 cm−3. This corresponds to an energy flux of 2 × 10−3 erg cm−2 s−1, which is of the order of a factor of ten less than the sub-solar EUV energy flux. 2.4. Reaction list The reaction list describes ion–molecule and ion–electron recombination reactions for ion species containing carbon, ni- trogen and hydrogen. In a specific run, some oxygen-bearing ions (H2O +, H3O+, CH3OH2+, CH3CHOH+) are considered as well. We do not distinguish the different isomers for these ions, except for C3H3 + (see Section 3.1). Ion–molecule reactions are mostly retrieved from exist- ing compilations of experimental data (Anicich and McEwan, 1997; Anicich et al., 2006; McEwan and Anicich, 2007) and from recently-published articles. A few reactions are obtained from databases dedicated to the interstellar medium (UMIST 2006; OSU 2007). Rates and products for most of the hydro- carbon ions can be considered as well described by the reac- tion list. However, the reactivity of most N-bearing ions and some heavier hydrocarbon ions is not available and we have to estimate their major production and loss pathways, based on chemical arguments. For those ions whose associated neu- trals have a high PA, we assume that the 3 most abundant ions (HCNH+, CH5+, C2H5+) exchange a proton with the neutral at a rate of 3 × 10−9 cm3 s−1. Ion–electron recombination rates are retrieved from the literature. When the electron tempera- ture dependence has not been determined, we assume the rate constant to be proportional to T −0.7e and when no data is avail- able, we estimate the recombination rate to be equal to 7×10−7 (300/Te) 0.7 cm3 s−1. The reaction list thus constructed includes ∼150 ions containing up to 9 heavy atoms (carbon and nitro- gen). The ∼1250 reactions constituting the reaction list can be found as Supplementary material. 3. Results The composition of Titan’s ionosphere is governed by the flow of ionization to the constituents with the highest proton affinity. Thus, neutral species have a strong, even controlling, effect on the ion composition and the existence of many ions can only be understood as the consequence of significant den- sity of associated neutrals. The mole fractions of 19 neutrals inferred from the measured densities of the ions, our ionization rate and reaction list are given in Table 1. The calculated den- sities of ions are given in Table 2 and the model spectrum is compared to the INMS spectrum in Fig. 2. For many ions, production occurs through proton exchange reactions of the neutral with the abundant ions and loss occurs http://www.astrochymist.org/astrochymist_ism.html 726 V.

However, especially for the heavier ions, condensation reactions (reaction in which an ion and a molecule combine to form a larger ion with elimination of a small molecule) and radiative association reactions (reaction in which an ion and a molecule add to form a larger ion with emission of a photon) may also contribute to the production. In the following, we review the main production and loss pathways for those ions that are relevant to the density of neutrals. Their major production channels are illustrated in Fig. 3. We discuss the assumptions made in our model, and the reactions that need to be further studied in the laboratory. 3.1. Hydrocarbon ions The primary ions produced by electron impact are N2 +, N+, CH4 +, CH3+, CH2+, CH+ and C+. The principal production (reactions ki ) and loss reactions (reactions ki and αi ) of the main ions are listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. CH5 + at m/z = 17 (8 cm−3 in the observed spectrum) is closely linked to the ionization of both N2 and CH4 through re- actions k1 plus k2 and k3, respectively. This ion is mostly lost through reactions with C2H4, HCN and C2H2 (k4–k6), and elec- tron dissociative recombination (α1). C2H5 + at m/z = 29 (50 cm−3 in the observed spectrum) is closely linked to the ionization of CH4 through reactions k7 and k2, k3 plus k8. This ion is mostly lost through electron disso- ciative recombination (α2), and reactions with HCN and C2H4 (k9, k10). Note that because C2H4 has only a moderate PA, the major formation channel for C2H5 + is not a proton exchange reaction. Consequently, the abundance of C2H4 cannot be in- ferred from the protonated molecule, C2H5 +, as is done for the other neutrals. However, it can be retrieved from C3H5 +. C3H5 + at m/z = 41 (50 cm−3 in the observed spectrum) is produced largely via reactions with C2H4 and CH4 (k11, k12), and mostly lost through electron dissociative recombination (α3). From reactions k11 and α3, a mole fraction of 1.0 × 10−3 for C2H4 can be retrieved. C3H3 + is known to exist in two possible low-energy forms: the acyclic propargyl ion, l-C3H3 +, and the cyclopropenylium ion, c-C3H3 +, the latter being much less reactive than the for- mer. C3H3 + is one of the most abundant ions in the spectrum (∼90 cm−3) and while c-C3H3+ is exclusively lost by elec- 728 V. Vuitton et al. / Icarus 191 (2007) 722–742 Fig. 3. Flowchart representing the major reactions used to determine the neutral densities. tron recombination (α4), l-C3H3 + can react to form heavier ions (k13, k14). It is consequently important to distinguish these 2 species when trying to fit the INMS spectrum. The major sources of C3H3 + (m/z = 39) in our model are via the reac- tions of various ions with C2H2 (k15–k17). The conformation of the C3H3 + product was not established for these reactions. We tried to determine an approximate ratio of l-C3H3 +/c-C3H3+ by making measurements using Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS). A titration reaction using C2H2 or C2H4 as the titrant allowed an estimate of the isomeric ratio to be found. l-C3H3 + is reactive with the titrant but c-C3H3+ is not. It was found that the first reaction gives ∼75% of l-C3H3+ while its yield in the third reaction is <10% (Edwards et al., in preparation). Because of its low rate constant, the amount of C3H3 + produced in the second reaction was insufficient to allow a determination of the isomeric ratio. This leaves us with a lower limit for the ratio of l-C3H3 +/c-C3H3+ of 20%. Our model underestimates the density at m/z = 39 by a fac- tor of 3. c-C3H3 + being much less reactive than l-C3H3+, it contributes to most of the signal at m/z = 39 and decreasing the l-C3H3 +/c-C3H3+ would increase the density at m/z = 39. However, even if all C3H3 + has the c-C3H3+ structure, the den- sity at m/z = 39 increases by 25% only. Note that a factor of 3 is within the error bars induced by uncertainties in the reaction rates and quantum yields (Carrasco et al., 2007). We identify m/z = 51 as C4H3+ (30 cm−3 in the observed spectrum). This ion, first mentioned in Fox and Yelle (1997), is mostly produced in our model from proton exchange reac- tions (k18, k19). Condensation and radiative association reac- tions are negligible (∼3%). C4H3+ is lost through electron dis- sociative recombination (α5) and reaction with C2H4 and C2H2 (k20, k21). A C4H2 mole fraction of 1 × 10−5 is determined from the density of C4H3 +. The density of C5H5 + at m/z = 65 (30 cm−3 in the observed spectrum) is well reproduced in the model via two condensation reactions (k22, k23) and loss through electron dissociative re- combination (α6). It follows that proton transfer reactions from protonated neutrals with low PA to C5H4 have to be negligible for the model not to overestimate the ion densities. We can then retrieve an upper limit of 10−6 for the mole fraction of C5H4. The ion at m/z = 75 (3 cm−3 in the observed spec- trum), C6H3 +, has not been predicted to be present in Titan’s ionosphere. It is almost exclusively produced in our model from proton exchange reactions with C6H2 (k24, k25) and lost N-containing molecules in Titan’s upper atmosphere 729 Table 3 Principal production reactions for the main ions.

The major condensation reaction producing C6H3 + (k27) for a measured C4H3+ density of 30 cm−3 and a C4H2 mole fraction of 10 −5, would give a C6H3+ density of ∼0.3 cm−3. This is a factor of 10 lower than observed; thus C6H3 + is produced primarily by proton exchange and the re- quired C6H2 mole fraction is 8 × 10−7. C6H7 + at m/z = 79 (8 cm−3 in the observed spectrum) is mostly produced by proton exchange reactions (k28, k29) and from k30 involving C2H4. It is lost almost entirely to electron dissociative recombination (α8). Condensation and radiative as- sociation reactions, including k30, contribute to about 30% of the measured density at m/z = 79. We retrieve a mole fraction for C6H6 of about 3 × 10−6. Note that the reaction between C5H5 + and C3H4 suggested by Keller et al. (1998) as a main production channel for C6H7 + has recently been reinvestigated (Anicich et al., 2006). The reaction was found to be slow and an upper limit of 5.0 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 was obtained. As a con- sequence, this process is a negligible source of C6H7 + in our model. None of the previous models predicted C7H5 + at m/z = 89 (8 cm−3 in the observed spectrum). This ion is mostly formed via proton exchange reactions (k31, k32) and from the conden- sation reaction k33 involving C4H2. It is lost almost entirely to electron dissociative recombination (α9). With condensation re- actions alone and a C4H2 mole fraction of 10 −5, our calculated density at m/z = 89 would be a factor of 10 smaller than the ob- served density. We infer a mole fraction of C7H4 of 3 × 10−7. The situation is a bit more complicated for C7H9 + at m/z = 93 (0.7 cm−3 in the observed spectrum), because of the lack of chemical pathways to produce this ion. C7H9 + production rate from any exothermic condensation reaction, even if happening at the collisional rate, falls short by at least an order of mag- nitude. Proton exchange reactions of C7H8 with abundant ions seem to be the only process efficient enough to reproduce the C7H9 + density (k34, k35). We assume that this ion is mostly lost through electron recombination (α10) and retrieve a C7H8 mole fraction of 2 × 10−7. Data on reactions forming C8H3 +, at m/z = 99 are very scarce as well (0.8 cm−3 in the observed spectrum). Similar condensation reactions as those forming C6H3 + should apply to C8H3 +, for example reaction k36. However, the analogous reaction could only account for 10% of the C6H3 + density. Similarly, k36 implies a density for C8H3 + of 3 × 10−2, that is a factor of 25 lower than observed. Other possible reactions are even less efficient. Proton exchange reactions are again re- quired to explain the density of C8H3 + (k37, k38). We assume that C8H3 + is mostly lost through electron recombination (α11) and infer a mole fraction for C8H2 of 2 × 10−7. 3.2. N-bearing species NH4 + at m/z = 18 (10 cm−3 in the observed spectrum) is almost exclusively created by proton attachment to NH3 as in- dicated by reactions k39 and k40 (Cravens et al., 2006) and lost through electron dissociative recombination (α12). A mole frac- tion for NH3 of 7 × 10−6 is required to match the observed density of 10 cm−3 at m/z = 18. Proton exchange of C2H5 + and CH5+ with HCN (k41, k42) is responsible for ∼70% of the HCNH+ production at m/z = 28 (300 cm−3 in the observed spectrum). The remainder of the production is via various condensation reactions (k43, k44) in agreement with previous models (Banaszkiewicz et al., 2000; Fox and Yelle, 1997; Keller et al., 1998). Electron dissocia- tive recombination (α13) and proton exchange to HC3N and C2H3CN account for 80% of the loss of HCNH + (k45, k46). We retrieve a mole fraction of 2 × 10−4 for HCN.

However, the calculated density is about 2 orders of magnitude too low. We have a good measurement of CH3 + from the spec- trum and we know the NH3 density from m/z = 18 so there are not any degrees of freedom. Some reactions involving CH3NH2 could produce CH2NH2 + if CH3NH2 were present in apprecia- ble amount (k48, k49). However, there is no detectable signal at m/z = 32, indicating that the CH3NH3+ and CH3NH2 den- sities are low. We retrieve an upper limit for the mole fraction of CH3NH2 of 10 −8 (see Section 3.3). This density is far too small for reactions k48 and k49 to produce a significant amount of CH2NH2 +. It follows that proton transfer from protonated neutrals with lower PA than CH2NH is the major production of CH2NH2 + (k50, k51). We assume the main loss to be electron dissociative recombination (α14) and we retrieve a mole frac- tion for CH2NH of 1 × 10−5. 732 V. Vuitton et al. / Icarus 191 (2007) 722–742 Proton attachment to CH3CN, HC3N and C2H3CN accounts for more than 80% of the production of CH3CNH + at m/z = 42 (k52, k53), HC3NH + at m/z = 52 (k54, k55), and C2H3CNH+ at m/z = 54 (k56, k57). Experimental data are available for most of the reactions and there is little doubt about these processes. Because of the high density of these three ions in the ob- served spectrum (>50 cm−3), it is difficult to imagine miss- ing condensation or radiative association reactions that would be efficient enough to produce them. Note that HC3NH + had been predicted to be produced at a high rate via proton ex- change reactions (Keller et al., 1998). All three species are almost exclusively lost through electron dissociative recombi- nation (α15–α17) and we retrieve mole fractions for CH3CN, HC3N and C2H3CN of 3 × 10−6, 4 × 10−5 and 1 × 10−5, re- spectively. The formation of C2H5CNH + at m/z = 56 is not as clear- cut. The main production reaction available in the literature for C2H5CNH + (k58) is ∼400 times too slow. Some miss- ing condensation reactions of hydrocarbon ions with HCN or CH3CN producing C2H5CNH + can be conceived but in the absence of data, we consider that the most likely process to pro- duce C2H5CNH + is proton attachment to C2H5CN (k59, k60). C2H5CNH + is exclusively lost through electron dissociative re- combination (α18) and we retrieve a mole fraction for C2H5CN of 5 × 10−7. Few reactions in the database can form C4H3NH + at m/z = 66. The only one that could potentially produce a large amount of this ion is the radiative association k61. However, this reaction was studied in a SIFT apparatus at ∼0.5 Torr, a pres- sure at which the adduct is collisionally stabilized (McEwan et al., 1994). On Titan, only bimolecular radiative stabilization occurs and since this process is less efficient than collisional stabilization, the above rate constant can be considered as an upper limit. Another point regarding this reaction is that it in- volves the propargyl ion l-C3H3 +. As mentioned previously, we find a lower limit for the ratio of l-C3H3 +/c-C3H3+ of 20%. We estimate that the reaction contributes to ∼20% of the to- tal density at m/z = 66, though the uncertainty in both the rate constant and the l-C3H3 + mole fraction must be kept in mind. Even if the mole fraction of l-C3H3 + is slightly higher, it does not seem that this reaction is able to account for the density at m/z = 66 (30 cm−3). Missing condensation reactions in- volving ions and neutrals abundant enough to reproduce the observed density do not seem to be producing this ion. As a re- sult, it seems likely that proton transfer to C4H3N is the major production mechanism for C4H3NH + (k62, k63). We assume C4H3NH + to be exclusively lost through electron dissociative recombination (α19) and we retrieve a mole fraction for C4H3N of 4 × 10−6. The only N-containing ion mostly formed in the model by condensation or associative reactions is C4H5NH + at m/z = 68 (k64). It follows that proton transfer reactions from pro- tonated neutrals with low PA to C4H5N have to be negligi- ble for the model not to overestimate the observed density at m/z = 68 (3 cm−3). We assume that C4H5NH+ is lost via electron dissociative recombination (α20) and retrieve an up- per limit of 3 × 10−7 for the mole fraction of C4H5N. Note that this ion was predicted at a high density as well by Keller et al. (1998) but was being formed by reaction k65. However, the rate constant used in the Keller et al. (1998) model is an up- per limit and the actual value is probably lower. Production of C4H5NH + from this reaction is not required for our model to fit m/z = 68, indicating that the rate constant must be less than 2.0 × 10−11 cm3 s−1. Another possibility is that we are missing some important loss reactions for this ion in the model. Data on reactions generating HC5NH +, C5H5NH+, C6H3- NH+ and C6H7NH+ at m/z = 76, 80, 90 and 94, respectively, are very scarce. The few reactions available can only produce a few percent of the observed density at best. Many condensation reactions involving heavy hydrocarbon ions and N-bearing neu- trals can possibly form these ions. However, in the absence of measurements, it appears reasonable to assume that the most ef- ficient mechanism producing these ions is proton exchange re- actions. Many isomers exist for these molecules but all present a high PA, suggesting that proton attachment is a fast process. We generalize their production channel as reactions k66 and k67 and assume their loss to occur exclusively through electron dis- sociative recombination (α21). We retrieve mole fractions for HC5N, C5H5N, C6H3N and C6H7N of 1 × 10−6, 4 × 10−7, 3 × 10−7 and 1 × 10−7, respectively. 3.3. Non-detected species Methylamine (CH3NH2) and hydrazine (N2H4) are pre- dicted as minor species in Titan’s upper atmosphere (Wilson and Atreya, 2004). Both have a high PA (Table 1) and are expected to undergo proton transfer with protonated neutrals with lower PA to create CH3NH3 + at m/z = 32 and N2H5+ at m/z = 33, respectively. Since we do not detect any measurable signal at these mass-to-charge ratios, we can retrieve an upper limit for the mole fraction of these species, by using reactions k68 plus k69, and k70 plus k71, respectively and estimated elec- tron recombination reactions α22 and α23. For an ion density of 0.1 cm−3, we retrieve an upper limit for the mole fraction of both species of 3 × 10−9 and 10−8. This is consistent with the values of 10−9 and 10−13 computed by Wilson and Atreya (2004) at 1100 km. By considering a water input flux from micrometeorites, pre-Cassini models predicted the formation of H3O + from proton exchange reactions of CH5 + and C2H5+ with H2O (Banaszkiewicz et al., 2000; Keller et al., 1998). The ion at m/z = 19 is below detection limit in the measured spectra (<0.2 cm−3) suggesting that the mole fraction of H2O is low. With the major production reactions k72 plus k73 and electron recombination (α24) as well as reaction k74 as the major loss reactions, we retrieve an upper limit of 3 × 10−7 for H2O. Four other oxygen-bearing species are predicted by photo- chemical models as minor species in Titan’s upper atmosphere (Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004): formaldehyde (H2CO), methanol (CH3OH), ketene (CH2CO) and acetalde- hyde (CH3CHO). All these species have a high PA (Table 1) and are expected to undergo proton transfer with protonated neu- trals with lower PA to create their associated ions at m/z = 31, 33, 43 and 45, respectively. The presence of C2H7 + and C3H7+ N-containing molecules in Titan’s upper atmosphere 733 at m/z = 31 and 43 prevents us from retrieving any informa- tion on the presence of H2CO or CH2CO in Titan’s upper at- mosphere. We do not detect any measurable signal at m/z = 33 and 45, indicating that the abundance of CH3OH and CH3CHO is low. Note that as mentioned above, N2H5 + would appear at m/z = 33 as well. As a consequence, the sum of CH3OH2+ and N2H5 + densities is less than 0.1 cm−3 (Fig. 2). We retrieve an upper limit for the mole fraction of these species, by using reactions k74 plus k75, and k76 plus k77, re- spectively and electron recombination reactions α25 and α26. We find an upper limit for the mole fraction of CH3OH and CH3CHO of 3 × 10−8 and 10−8, respectively. This is consis- tent with the values of 10−10 computed by Wilson and Atreya (2004) at 1100 km. Note that ethylene oxide (c-C2H4O), an iso- mer of acetaldehyde, was reported by Bernard et al. (2003) in simulation experiments. Very little is known about ion–neutral chemistry of this species. Based on acetaldehyde’s and ethylene oxide’s similar proton affinities (768.5 and 774.2 kJ/mol, re- spectively), we estimate an upper limit for ethylene oxide close to 10−8. Another family of species expected in Titan’s atmosphere is dicyanopolyynes of general formula CnN2, where n is an even integer (Lara et al., 1996; Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004). The low PA of the dicyanopolyynes com- bined with the presence of C4H5 + and C6H5+ at m/z = 53 and 77 prevents us from retrieving any evidence of the presence of C2N2 or C4N2 in Titan’s upper atmosphere. For the same rea- son, we could not identify in the spectrum any ion containing two nitrogen atoms. 3.4. Error analysis Major sources of uncertainties for the neutral mole fractions arise from: (i) uncertainties in the measured ion densities, (ii) uncertainties in the ionization rate, (iii) uncertainties in the reac- tion list. Electron temperature and CH4 plus other hydrocarbon mixing ratios are well constrained by RPWS and INMS respec- tively and represent only minor sources of uncertainties. Uncertainties in the observed ion densities are due to count- ing statistics and calibration. Error bars reflecting the uncer- tainty due to counting statistics are included in Fig. 2. They become relatively larger for low density ions but are always smaller than the systematic ∼20% uncertainty due to calibra- tion. Uncertainties due to the description of the electron flux are difficult to quantify but the good agreement of the model with the observations for the primary ions suggests that they are small. A study on the propagation of the uncertainties on reac- tion rate constants and branching ratios in a Titan ion chemistry model found that densities of the heavier ions are uncertain by up to 110% (Carrasco et al., 2007). Consequently, we consider that the mole fraction of the neu- trals for which the chemistry is well known are uncertain by a factor of 2–3. These species are C2H4, C4H2, NH3, HCN, CH3CN, HC3N, and C2H3CN. Note that the mole fractions in- ferred for C2H4, C4H2 and CH3CN are smaller than the mole fractions presented in Vuitton et al. (2006a) by factors of a few. This decrease is due to improvements in the chemical reaction list, leading to more efficient proton transfer from these neutrals to the associated protonated ions. For other mostly heavier species, the chemistry is extremely uncertain and we assumed that some ions are mainly produced via proton attachment to the neutrals and lost through elec- tron recombination. This implies that condensation reactions, radiative association reactions or fragmentation of ions with m/z > 100 are minor processes. Measurement of the rate con- stants and products of the N-bearing closed-shell ions men- tioned in this paper with hydrocarbons is desperately needed. In the absence of evidence for such processes to occur, we believe that our approach is reasonable and do not consider it a major source of uncertainty. However, since we had to estimate the rate constants for most of these reactions, we consider that this increases the total uncertainty by an additional factor of 2. Mole fractions are then probably determined within a factor of 5. The model cannot reproduce the observed density of a few ions. For example, the observed density at m/z = 50 is un- derestimated by a factor of 20 by the model. This mass can be attributed to C3N + and C4H2+, but none of these species is an abundant product of the ion–neutral chemistry. Carrasco et al. (2007) and Keller et al. (1998) predict a substantial den- sity at m/z = 50 (Figs. 1 and 9 in Carrasco et al., 2007). The large amount of C2H2 used in these models (mole fraction of 2–8 × 10−3) is responsible for an important formation of C4H2 + from reaction of C2H2+ with C2H2. However, the C2H2 density is now well constrained by the INMS observations in the neutral model (Table 1) and this reaction cannot produce enough C4H2 + to explain the high density at m/z = 50. Note that the density at m/z = 64 is underestimated as well by the model (factor of 50). This corresponds to the addition of a – CH2 unit on the ion at m/z = 50 and it can be expected that analogous pathways will produce both ions at m/z = 50 and 64. The observed density at m/z = 63 (C5H3+) is underesti- mated by one order of magnitude while the observed density at m/z = 57 (C4H9+) is overestimated by one order of magnitude. As mentioned previously, the chemistry becomes very uncer- tain for these higher m/z and missing reactions can probably account for these discrepancies. Heavier neutrals not included in the model, such as C4H6 and C4H10 could also significantly contribute to the production/destruction of these ions. 4. Discussion We have inferred the mole fraction in Titan’s upper at- mosphere of 7 hydrocarbons and 12 N-bearing species. In the following, we will compare our results to (i) previous obser- vations at all levels of the atmosphere, (ii) laboratory simula- tions of Titan’s chemistry, (iii) photochemical models of neutral chemistry and (iv) interstellar medium. This helps in identify- ing the structure of the molecules (isomers) and in constraining production pathways, photolysis rates and chemical reactivity. Previous observations provide constraints on the abundance of several of the molecules identified here. The mole frac- tions of C2H4, HCN, and HC3N in the upper atmosphere have been inferred from the Voyager 1 solar occultation experiment (Vervack et al., 2004). The Composite InfraRed Spectrome- 734 V.

Ground-based microwave spectroscopy provides constraints on the upper stratospheric abundance of HCN, CH3CN, HC3N, C2H3CN, C2H5CN and HC5N (Marten et al., 2002). Neutral mole fractions at 300 km are listed in Table 1. Comparison of our results to these datasets provides density vertical profiles of the species that help con- strain their altitude of formation. Laboratory experiments relevant to the atmospheric chem- istry induced in Titan’s atmosphere by saturnian magneto- spheric electrons have been performed. Typically, a mixture of a few mbar of CH4 in N2 is flowing in a cold plasma discharge. The products are subsequently analyzed by an analytical proce- dure generally based on mass spectrometry and the production yield of each species is determined. In order to compare this value with the INMS results, we scale the production yields to C2H2 for the hydrocarbons and to HCN for the N-bearing species. Results and experimental conditions for a subset of the laboratory simulation experiments are presented in Table 5. Coll et al. (1999) use the most representative gas mixture and temperature. Because of experimental limitations, the pressure in all three experiments is orders of magnitude higher than in Titan’s upper atmosphere. In Coll et al. (1999) and Thompson et al. (1991) experiments, the products are collected in a cold trap and subsequently transferred to the analytical system while Fujii and Arai (1999) analyze the products in real time. Note the systematic higher yield of N-bearing species relative to HCN observed by Fujii and Arai (1999). The reason is that their tech- nique of Li+ ion association depends markedly on the number of atoms in the neutral molecule. The rate of attachment of Li+ to HCN is very much slower than to the larger nitriles hence the ratios measured always favor the larger molecules (Edwards et al., 2006). Laboratory simulations results are further compared with our results on Titan’s atmosphere below. Photochemical models of Titan’s neutral chemistry extend- ing from the surface to the upper atmosphere have been de- veloped (Lara et al., 1996; Toublanc et al., 1995; Yung et al., 1984). Recent models also include a subset of ion–molecule chemistry in the upper atmosphere (Banaszkiewicz et al., 2000; Wilson and Atreya, 2004). The models describe the chemi- cal and physical processes taking place in the atmosphere, and compute the vertical profiles of the chemical compounds. Neu- tral mole fractions obtained at 1100 km are listed in Table 6. Comparison of our results to these predictions provides a test for the reaction set used in the models and helps constrain the production and loss pathways for the chemical species. It is interesting to note that most of the species identified in this work have already been observed in the interstellar (ISM) and circumstellar medium. The ISM is a very complex envi- ronment, with wide differences in densities, gas composition, temperature and energy sources. It is not our goal here to per- form a thorough review of the abundance of molecules in the different parts of the ISM. Even for a single source, obser- vations are scattered and it is often difficult to reconcile line of sight abundances obtained by different teams, with differ- ent telescopes, different data reduction techniques, etc. Instead, we focused on two objects known as good organic chemistry factories for which consistent sets of data were acquired: the Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC-1) and the proto-planetary neb- ula CRL 618. TMC-1 is a prototypical dark cloud with a ki- netic temperature of 10 K that contains a number of differ- N-containing molecules in Titan’s upper atmosphere 735 Table 6 Neutral mole fractions of selected compounds at 1100 km computed by photochemical models Yung et al.

CRL 618 is a carbon-rich proto-planetary nebula (C/O > 1), with kinetic tem- peratures between 200 and 250 K in the region where the mole- cules are observed. 4.1. Unsaturated N-bearing species We inferred the presence of NH3 in Titan’s upper at- mosphere, with a mole fraction of 7×10−6 (Table 1). Although not previously detected on Titan (upper limit of 6.3 × 10−9 in the stratosphere), NH3 has been produced in laboratory ex- periments simulating Titan’s conditions (Bernard et al., 2003; Fujii and Arai, 1999), and a photochemical model predicts its presence in the upper atmosphere (Wilson and Atreya, 2004), although at a low density (mole fraction of 4 × 10−8). In the Wilson and Atreya (2004) model, production of NH3 in the ionosphere occurs via initial formation of NH4 + and its subsequent electron recombination to NH3. The mechanism, first proposed in Atreya (1986), consists of an initial reaction of N+ with H2 giving NH+, followed by successive reactions of NHn + (n = 1,2,3) with H2 and CH4. However, because of the low density of H2 in Titan’s atmosphere, the initial reaction produces only a small concentration of NH+ (7.0×10−3 cm−3) in our model and this pathway is only responsible for 1% of our NH4 + production. This is consistent with Wilson and Atreya (2004) underestimating by 2 orders of magnitude, the NH3 abundance. Another pathway suggested by these authors involves the recombination of H atoms and NH2 radicals. How- ever, this process requires a collision with a third body and is not efficient at the low pressure of the upper atmosphere (10−7 mbar). NH3 is ubiquitous in the ISM where it is formed on grain sur- faces by consecutive addition of H atoms onto NH (Lequeux, 2005). NH radicals are readily available only in the upper at- mosphere on Titan. Data from the UltraVIolet Spectrometer (UVIS) onboard Cassini seems to show some evidence for the presence of haze up to 750 km and maybe higher (Liang et al., 2007). If this is confirmed, heterogeneous chemistry tak- ing place at the surface of the aerosols might be the key to the formation of NH3 on Titan. We inferred the presence of CH2NH in Titan’s upper at- mosphere, with a mole fraction of 1×10−5 (Table 1). Although not previously detected on Titan, CH2NH has been produced in a laboratory experiment simulating Titan’s conditions (Fujii and Arai, 1999). CH2NH is observed in the ISM, where it is formed by gas-phase chemistry as well as on grain surfaces (Dickens et al., 1997). A single photochemical model considers CH2NH as a product of Titan’s atmospheric chemistry (Lara et al., 1996). A CH2NH production only ∼6 times lower than the HCN pro- duction is calculated. Unfortunately, its fate after production is not followed and its abundance cannot be retrieved. In this model, it is assumed that CH2NH is formed in the reaction be- tween NH and CH3. It was recently confirmed that CH2NH is indeed the major product in this reaction (Redondo et al., 2006). The reaction between N(2D) and CH4 could also con- tribute to the formation of CH2NH (Herron, 1999) since both species are abundant in Titan’s upper atmosphere. As a conse- quence, CH2NH should be a significant product of the neutral chemistry. Heterogeneous chemistry could also contribute to the formation of CH2NH if aerosols are present in the upper atmosphere. It may be presumed that CH2NH is lost by photol- ysis and/or condensation. NH3 and CH2NH are the first two N-containing species de- tected on Titan for which the N atom is not sequestered in a –C≡N group. This is particularly interesting since the N atom is available to further react and produce more complex species. For example, polymerization of CH2NH at low temperature to produce a cyclic trimer (hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine) has been suggested in model interstellar icy grain mantles (Bernstein et al., 1995). 4.2. Saturated nitriles We inferred the presence in the upper atmosphere of three saturated nitriles, HCN, CH3CN, and C2H5CN. The mole frac- tion of HCN determined in our analysis (2 × 10−4) is in good agreement with the value inferred from the Voyager 1 solar occultation experiment, although obtained at 100 km lower alti- tude (Vervack et al., 2004). CIRS measurements at 80◦ N show a steady decrease in HCN mole fraction from 10−5 to 10−6 be- tween 500 and 300 km (Vinatier et al., 2007). Ground-based mi- 736 V. Vuitton et al. / Icarus 191 (2007) 722–742 Fig. 4. Plot of the logarithm (base 10) of the mole fractions of polyynes (CnH2, circles), cyanopolyynes (HCmN, diamonds) and methylcyanopolyynes (CH3CnN, triangles) versus the number of carbon atoms in the linear chain (n,m) as retrieved using our ion chemistry model. The dashed lines result from a fit to the data and their slopes are presented in Table 5. The mole fraction of CH3CN is not included in the fit and is represented by an open triangle. crowave spectroscopy provides a disk average mole fraction at 450 km of 8×10−7 and 4×10−8 for HCN and CH3CN respec- tively and an upper limit of 2×10−9 for C2H5CN (Marten et al., 2002). These values are a factor of ∼200 smaller than those de- rived in the upper atmosphere. The fact that all 3 species present about the same gradient from upper to lower atmosphere indi- cates that their evolution is closely related. This is fully consis- tent with production in the upper atmosphere and diffusion to lower altitudes, where loss occurs through chemistry and con- densation. The three nitriles are ubiquitous in laboratory experiments as shown in Table 5 (Coll et al., 1999; Fujii and Arai, 1999; Thompson et al., 1991). As mentioned earlier, the higher yields of CH3CN and C2H5CN found by Fujii and Arai (1999) are attributed to the Li+ attachment technique. All three species are observed in various sources in the ISM (Lequeux, 2005). Photochemical models (Banaszkiewicz et al., 2000; Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004; Yung et al., 1984) tend to overestimate the HCN mole fraction by a factor of a few. Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000) and Toublanc et al. (1995) pre- dict a CH3CN mole fraction that is 3 orders of magnitude too small. Wilson and Atreya (2004) calculate a CH3CN mole frac- tion in agreement with our value, with insertion of N(2D) into C2H4 being the major production reaction. None of the photo- chemical models consider C2H5CN. In the ISM, the reaction of protonated ethanol with HCN followed by electron recombina- tion is thought to be the main C2H5CN source (Charnley, 1997). On Titan, ethyl cation transfer to HCN is probably not impor- tant since species having a PA higher than HCN have a low density. Formation pathways similar to those forming CH3CN such as insertion of N(2D) into C3H6 can be expected. This re- action will have to be included in future models. 4.3. Polyyne families Polyynes are species with general formula CnH2 (n is an even integer) that are separated by 24 amu. We inferred the pres- ence in Titan’s upper atmosphere of the 4 first members of this family, with mole fractions presented in Table 1. C4H2 is ubiquitous in laboratory experiments simulating Ti- tan’s conditions and is produced at a yield relative to C2H2 of about 10−3 as showed in Table 5 (Coll et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 1991). The high C4H2/C2H2 ratio obtained by Fujii and Arai (1999) probably reflects the slow attachment of Li+ to C2H2 compared to the larger molecule C4H2. C6H2 has been observed in experiments performed at low temperature (100– 150 K) (Coll et al., 1999). Photochemical models predict the formation of polyyne chains through neutral chemistry path- ways, with a maximum production around 800 km (Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004; Yung et al., 1984). For- mation in the thermosphere is consistent with the observed 3 orders of magnitude decrease in C4H2 mole fraction from 1100 to 300 km (Coustenis et al., 1989; Vinatier et al., 2007). C2H2, C4H2 and C6H2 have been detected in the direction of the proto- planetary nebula CRL 618 (Cernicharo et al., 2001). The logarithm of the mole fractions of CnH2 as retrieved using our ion chemistry model is plotted as circles in Fig. 4. The slope of the line that results from a fit to the data is pre- sented in Table 7. The same slope as computed from the yields in laboratory experiments, from the predictions of photochem- ical models at 1100 km and from the observations in CRL 618 are presented in Table 7 as well. We find that the mole fraction of the polyynes inferred from the INMS data decreases with in- creasing number of carbon atoms at a rate 2 to 4 times slower than predicted by photochemical models (Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004; Yung et al., 1984) and about 6 times slower than produced in laboratory simulations (Coll et al., 1999). C6H2 and to a lesser extend C4H2 tend to polymerize rapidly at room temperature and might be lost during transfer to the analytical device. On the contrary, they decrease at a rate 2.5 faster than in CRL 618. In photochemical models dedicated to Titan, polyyne growth is initiated with their photodissociation followed by insertion of the radical formed: CnH2 + hν → CnH + H, CnH + Cn′H2 → Cn+n′H2 + H. N-containing molecules in Titan’s upper atmosphere 737 Table 7 The slope of the logarithm (base 10) of the mole fractions of polyynes (CnH2), cyanopolyynes (HCmN), methylpolyynes (CH3CnH) and methylcyanopolyynes (CH3CmN) versus the number of carbon atoms in the linear chain (n,m), as computed in photochemical models, as measured in laboratory experiments, as observed in CRL 618 and TMC-1 and as retrieved using our ion chemistry model.

Earlier Titan models relied mostly on data obtained in py- rolysis conditions that were extrapolated to Titan’s conditions (Toublanc et al., 1995; Yung et al., 1984). Recent experiments performed at low temperature show that C2H actually reacts about 4 times faster than assumed in these models (Chastaing et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2000; Vakhtin et al., 2001). Other recent data include low temperature measurements of the absorption cross sections of C2H2, C4H2 and C6H2 and photolysis quan- tum yields of C2H2 (Bénilan et al., 1995, 2000; Läuter et al., 2002; Smith et al., 1998). These studies indicate an increased production rate of C2H from C2H2 photolysis and updated models should lead to a more efficient formation of the higher polyynes than is currently computed, in agreement with our results (Table 7). Other laboratory measurements required to improve photochemical models include rate constants for C4H (and heavier) radicals as well as photolysis branching ratios for C4H2 and heavier polyynes (Vuitton et al., 2006b). We define cyanopolyynes as species with general formula HCmN, where m is an odd integer. We inferred the presence in the upper atmosphere of the first 3 members of this fam- ily, HCN, HC3N and HC5N. HC3N is ubiquitous in labora- tory experiments but its yield relative to HCN varies by 2 or- ders of magnitude as showed in Table 5 (Coll et al., 1999; Fujii and Arai, 1999; Thompson et al., 1991). HC5N is not stable at 300 K but has been observed in low temperature (100– 150 K) experiments (Coll et al., 1999). Cyanopolyyne chains containing up to 7 and 11 carbon atoms have been observed in CRL 618 and TMC-1, respectively (Cernicharo et al., 2001; Remijan et al., 2006). The logarithm of the mole fractions of HCmN as retrieved using our ion chemistry model is plotted as diamonds in Fig. 4. The slope of the line that results from a fit to the data is pre- sented in Table 7. The same slope, as computed from the yields in laboratory experiments and from the observations in CRL 618 and TMC-1 are presented in Table 7 as well. Whatever this slope is, it is striking to see that the mole fraction of polyynes and cyanopolyynes decreases with increasing number of carbon at an almost identical rate in laboratory experiments, Titan’s atmosphere and the proto-planetary nebula. This is consistent with the fact that they are structurally similar (an H atom is replaced by a CN group) and are formed through similar path- ways: CnH2 + hν → CnH + H, CnH + HCmN → HCn+mN + H and/or HCmN + hν → CmN + H, CmN + CnH2 → HCn+mN + H. In Titan photochemical models, the production peak arises around 800 km, consistent with an observed 3 orders of magni- tude higher mole fraction at 1100 km than at 300 km (Coustenis et al., 1989; Teanby et al., 2006). However, photochemical mod- els systematically underestimate our inferred HC3N density at 1100 km by a factor of a few (Banaszkiewicz et al., 2000; Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004), probably be- cause of the lack of data on the photodissociation and kinetics of the species involved. Formation of cyanopolyynes other than HC3N has not been quantified so far, but these species have been considered in polymer-producing schemes (Lebonnois et al., 2002; Wilson and Atreya, 2003). We inferred the presence of C7H4 from the observation of C7H5 + at m/z = 89. C5H5+ at m/z = 65 is efficiently formed through condensation reactions and we could only retrieve an upper limit for the mole fraction of C5H4. None of these species have been observed in laboratory simulations or included in photochemical models. However both methyldiacetylene (CH3C4H) and methyltriacetylene (CH3C6H) have been ob- served in TMC-1 (Remijan et al., 2006; Walmsley et al., 1984). The mole fraction of methylpolyynes decreases with increasing number of carbon at a rate similar within experimental uncer- tainties to the rate of polyynes and cyanopolyynes (Table 7), suggesting that the mechanism of forming the three carbon- chain sequences are highly correlated. With two data points only and the large uncertainty in the mole fraction of C7H4, it was not possible to constrain a trend in the growth process of methylpolyynes on Titan. However, the data do not disagree with the slope observed for polyynes and cyanopolyynes. It has been shown that the reaction between the ethynyl radical, C2H, and methylacetylene, yields two C5H4 isomers, methyldiacetylene (CH3C4H) and to a minor amount ethiny- lallene (H2C3H(C2H)) (Stahl et al., 2002). The reaction is fast 738 V. Vuitton et al. / Icarus 191 (2007) 722–742 (Hoobler and Leone, 1999), C2H and CH3C2H are present in Titan’s upper atmosphere, and these species should be a sig- nificant product of the neutral chemistry. Similarly, C4H could react with CH3C2H and/or C2H with CH3C4H to produce the C7H4 isomers. We inferred the presence of C4H3N and C6H3N from the observation of C4H3NH + and C6H3NH+ at m/z = 66 and 90. Methylcyanoacetylene, CH3C3N, is ubiquitous in laboratory experiments (Coll et al., 1999; Fujii and Arai, 1999; Thompson et al., 1991). Its high yield in the Fujii and Arai (1999) ex- periment is again a bias introduced by the Li+ attachment technique (Table 5). C6H3N has never been observed in such experiments. Neither C4H3N nor C6H3N has been included in photochemical models. Both C4H3N and C6H3N have been observed in TMC-1 (Broten et al., 1984; Lovas et al., 2006; Snyder et al., 2006). It is interesting to note that two isomers of C4H3N were identified and that cyanoallene (CH2CCHCN) was found to be ∼4.5 times more abundant than the more sta- ble form, methylcyanoacetylene (CH3C3N). When it comes to C6H3N, only methylcyanodiacetylene (CH3C5N) has been de- tected so far. The reaction between CN + CH3C2H is fast (Carty et al., 2001) and produces in collisionless conditions both C4H3N iso- mers, methylcyanoacetylene and cyanoallene (Balucani et al., 2000). The detection of both isomers in TMC-1 and the obser- vation that the mole fraction of C4H3N and C6H3N decreases with increasing numbers of carbon at a rate almost identical as the rate inferred for cyanopolyynes (Table 7) strongly suggests that this reaction is responsible for the formation of C4H3N in TMC-1. The same trend is seen in Titan’s atmosphere as well (Fig. 4, Table 7). CN and CH3C2H are present in Titan’s upper atmosphere and as a consequence CH3C3N and H2C3(CN)H should be a significant product of the neutral chemistry. Sim- ilar reactions involving heavier hydrocarbons or C3N radicals could produce C6H3N. 4.4. Other N-bearing species We inferred the presence of C2H3CN in Titan’s upper at- mosphere, with a mole fraction of 1×10−5 (Table 1). Although not previously detected on Titan, C2H3CN is produced in lab- oratory experiments simulating Titan’s conditions (Coll et al., 1999; Fujii and Arai, 1999; Thompson et al., 1991), and is pre- dicted by neutral chemistry models (Lebonnois et al., 2002; Wilson and Atreya, 2004). In the Wilson and Atreya (2004) model, production of C2H3CN occurs mainly in the upper at- mosphere (∼1000 km) via the reaction between CN and C2H4. This high altitude production is in agreement with the sharp decrease in C2H3CN density from the upper to the lower at- mosphere, where an upper limit of 2.0 × 10−9 has been re- trieved (Marten et al., 2002). However, the Wilson and Atreya (2004) prediction for C2H3CN at 1100 km is too low by a factor of ∼10. C2H3CN has been detected in various sources outside the Solar System (Lequeux, 2005). The total rate constant of the reaction between CN and C2H4 is well established, even at low temperature (Herbert et al., 1992; Sims et al., 1993). However, branching fractions for the 2 possible channels (C2H3CN + H and C2H3 + HCN) are not. Wilson and Atreya (2004) assume from Monks et al. (1993) a branching fraction of 0.2 for the channel forming C2H3CN. However, more recent experiments suggested that the branch- ing fraction to C2H3CN is close to 1 (Balucani et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2004). This is an interesting possibility since it would increase the formation of C2H3CN at the expense of HCN, which is slightly overestimated by Wilson and Atreya (2004). This hypothesis will have to be tested in future models. From the ion densities at m/z = 80 and 94, we infer the pres- ence of a few tenths of a ppm of C5H5N and C6H7N in Titan’s upper atmosphere. In their laboratory simulation, Thompson et al. (1991) observe the formation of 2 isomers of C5H5N, penta-2,4-dienenitrile and 2-methylene-3-butenenitrile, the for- mer being observed by Coll et al. (1999) as well. Both groups detect a C6H7N species, that Thompson et al. (1991) tentatively attribute to 2,4-hexadienenitrile. However, many other isomers are possible, including cycles such as pyridine (C5H5N) and aniline (C6H5NH2). Neither species has been detected in any extraterrestrial object. Clearly, new processes are required to explain their presence in Titan’s upper atmosphere. 4.5. Aromatic hydrocarbons We infer the presence in the upper atmosphere of a few ppm of C6H6. This is in good agreement with the detection of C6H6 obtained by INMS in the neutral mode for low- altitude flybys (Vuitton et al., 2007). Benzene has been ob- served in various laboratory experiments (Coll et al., 1999; Fujii and Arai, 1999). Wilson et al. (2003) and Wilson and Atreya (2004) find that the primary mechanism responsible for the benzene formation is the recombination of propargyl (C3H3) radicals, with ion chemistry being the principal source of benzene molecules in the upper atmosphere. However, these processes only lead to a benzene mole fraction of 10−8 at the production peak (750 km) and 10−10 at 1100 km, 3 or- ders of magnitude lower than observed by INMS. Lebonnois (2005), in a sensitivity study of benzene production in Titan’s atmosphere, obtains a mole fraction of benzene up to 10−5 at the production peak, decreasing to a few 10−7 at 1100 km. However, this result is obtained with a propargyl self-reaction rate of 1.2×10−10 cm3 s−1 (Morter et al., 1994). Three very re- cent studies at 295 K report a three times lower rate coefficient that supersedes the former value (Atkinson and Hudgens, 1999; De Sain and Taatjes, 2003; Fahr and Nayak, 2000). Using this lower rate leads only to a 20–50 percent decrease of benzene according to Lebonnois (2005). Benzene production pathways are generally based on stud- ies dedicated to combustion conditions that are poorly relevant to Titan. For example, the recombination rate for propargyl rad- icals has never been measured below room temperature or in its low-pressure range. The low-pressure rate constant is then gen- erally assumed to be equal to 10 times the recombination rate of methyl (CH3) radicals because of the higher number of chan- nels available to redistribute the excess energy. A faster rate could significantly enhance the benzene mole fraction in the upper atmosphere. However, the large abundance in the ther- N-containing molecules in Titan’s upper atmosphere 739 mosphere implies that C6H6 is created in the upper atmosphere. This strongly suggests that C6H6 is most likely created by a 2-body process. For example, the reaction between C2H and butadiene (1,3-C4H6) is fast (k = 3 × 10−10 cm3 s−1) and bu- tadiene is efficiently produced in the recombination of C2H3 radicals (Fahr et al., 1991; Nizamov and Leone, 2004). The products have not been determined but it is usually believed that the reaction of C2H with unsaturated molecules proceeds via attack of a π -orbital followed by rapid loss of an H atom by the energized complex initially formed, to form a C6H6 mole- cule in this case. Large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been proposed as the carriers of the unidentified interstellar bands (UIBs), but identification of specific PAH molecules outside the Solar System has been elusive. Only recently has benzene been detected in the direction of the proto–planetary nebula CRL 618. Polymerization of acetylene induced by the UV pho- tons coming from the hot central star or by the shocks associ- ated with its high-velocity winds may be prominently involved in the formation of benzene (Cernicharo et al., 2001). The C2H2/C6H6 ratio observed in CRL 618 and in Titan’s upper atmosphere is of the same order of magnitude (∼40 and ∼90, respectively) and it is possible similar production pathways in- duced by UV photons occur in both environments. Note that shocks do not occur on Titan. We infer the presence of a few tenths of a ppm of C7H8 in Titan’s upper atmosphere. Toluene is an aromatic ring with a methyl group. This species is produced in laboratory experi- ments simulating Titan’s conditions (Coll et al., 1999) but has not been included in photochemical models. It has not been observed in any extraterrestrial object to date. No gas phase reactions that could explain the presence of toluene in Titan’s atmosphere have been proposed so far. Its production from the addition of CH3 and C6H5 radicals has been shown to be quite efficient (k = 2×10−11 cm3 s−1) at room temperature and a few Torr pressure (Tokmakov et al., 1999). Another reaction possi- bly forming toluene is the addition of C3H3 and C4H5 radicals. Studies at low temperature and pressure are required in order to evaluate the efficiency of these processes in Titan’s upper at- mosphere. 4.6. Oxygen-bearing species Three oxygen-bearing species have been detected in Ti- tan’s lower stratosphere, namely CO, CO2 and H2O, with mole fractions of ∼5 × 10−5 (Flasar et al., 2005; Gurwell and Muhleman, 1995), ∼2 × 10−8 (Coustenis et al., 1989; Flasar et al., 2005) and ∼8 × 10−9 (Coustenis et al., 1998), re- spectively. While the origin of CO is not clear, it is believed that H2O is injected into Titan’s upper atmosphere by the ablation of micrometeorites. OH radicals subsequently produced by the photolysis of H2O react with CO to form CO2. Photochemical models require a downward flux of about 3 × 106 cm2 s−1 H2O molecules (referred to the surface) in order to reproduce the observed CO2 and H2O mixing ratios (Coustenis et al., 1998; Lara et al., 1996). This value is consistent with ablation mod- els that compute H2O deposition rates in the Saturn system (English et al., 1996; Feuchtgruber et al., 1997). However, with such a rate, photochemical models predict a H2O mole fraction of a few 10−5 at 1100 km. The upper limit retrieved here from the INMS ion spectrum for H2O is 2 orders of magnitude lower. This implies that the H2O deposition rate inferred by Lara et al. (1996) has to be revised. New photochemical models with up- dated transport and oxygen chemistry are required to settle this issue. 5. Conclusion We developed an ion-chemistry model in order to analyze INMS ion spectra obtained during the T5 flyby of Titan by the Cassini spacecraft. We identified the major ions present in Titan’s upper atmosphere and we showed that their density di- rectly depends on the composition of the neutral atmosphere. It follows that coupling measurement of the ion densities to our chemical model allows us to infer the mole fraction of 19 neu- trals in Titan’s upper atmosphere with mole fractions ranging from 10−7 to 10−3. They represent far more complex molecules than previously thought. We detect polyynes (C4H2, C6H2, C8H2) and cyanopolyynes (HC3N, HC5N) with densities orders of magnitude higher than predicted by photochemical models (Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004; Yung et al., 1984). Our results also indicate the probable presence of methylcyanopolyynes (CH3C3N, CH3C5N) and maybe methylpolyynes (CH3C4H, CH3C6H), species that are observed in the interstellar medium (Broten et al., 1984; MacLeod et al., 1984; Remijan et al., 2006; Snyder et al., 2006; Walmsley et al., 1984) but that had never really been considered for Titan. The data also sug- gests the presence of ammonia (NH3), methanimine (CH2NH), other nitriles (C2H3CN, C2H5CN) and two unidentified N- containing species (C5H5N, C6H7N). Finally, we confirm the detection by INMS in the neutral mode of benzene (C6H6) (Vuitton et al., 2007). Photochemical models do not reproduce the observed abundance or do not even predict the presence of these molecules in Titan’s atmosphere (Lara et al., 1996; Toublanc et al., 1995; Wilson and Atreya, 2004; Yung et al., 1984). Note that all these species are highly unsaturated, con- sistent with the 12 amu periodicity observed in the ion spec- trum. Comparison of our results in the upper atmosphere with available observations in the stratosphere (Marten et al., 2002; Teanby et al., 2006; Vinatier et al., 2007) show a strong density gradient from 300 to 1100 km for all the species. This con- firms the prediction of photochemical models that unsaturated hydrocarbons and N-containing species are mainly formed in the upper atmosphere. However, the current incapacity of pho- tochemical models to better match the observations reflects a dramatic lack of kinetic data in the low temperature and pres- sure conditions of Titan’s upper atmosphere. Only exothermic reactions can take place in Titan’s cold en- vironment and above 800 km, the chemistry is mostly driven by highly energetic radicals such CH, C2H, N( 2D) or CN. Radical recombination reactions are very exothermic but they require collisions with a third body to transfer the excess energy. The 740 V. Vuitton et al. / Icarus 191 (2007) 722–742 pressure dependence of this process is not well constrained for most reactions, especially at low temperature. Photochemical models generally use values extrapolated from the low-pressure rate constant for methyl–methyl recombination. However, this rate is itself uncertain by up to 2 orders of magnitude at 150 K (Moses et al., 2000). It follows that it is extremely difficult to establish the altitude dependence of 3-body reaction rates in Ti- tan’s atmosphere. If these reactions are still efficient at lower pressure than is currently assumed, the production rate of com- plex species through 3-body reactions could be significantly enhanced and shifted to higher altitudes. Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000) find that when ion chemistry is included in their model, the density of C2H2, C4H2 and HCN increases by a factor of about 3 and that the density of C3H4 increases by about one order of magnitude. This suggests that ion–molecule chemistry can significantly contribute to the for- mation of neutrals in the upper atmosphere. This process prob- ably occurs through electron recombination reactions. More experimental data on electron recombination rates for a wide range of electron temperature and on reaction products, es- pecially for heavier hydrocarbon ions and N-containing ions are crucial for the understanding of Titan’s ionospheric chem- istry. The species discussed here include the most complex mole- cules identified so far on Titan. This confirms the long-thought idea that a very rich chemistry is actually taken place in this atmosphere. These molecules are possibly the first intermedi- ates in the formation of even larger molecules. Consequently, Titan provides us with a unique opportunity to understand how large organic molecules are formed. Polyynes, cyanopolyynes, acrylonitrile and benzene have been suggested as precursors in the formation of Titan’s aerosols (Lebonnois et al., 2002; Wilson and Atreya, 2003). Aerosols influence all levels of the atmosphere through radiative transfer as well as the surface ap- pearance and composition. Note that the region of maximum aerosol production obtained by photochemical models is lower than required by microphysical models (150–200 km versus 200–400 km). It is doubtful that dynamical effects could ex- plain this discrepancy alone. Considering the higher density of aerosol precursors in the upper atmosphere would certainly help solving this problem. Further studies constraining the rate and altitude of production of the species inferred here is then of pri- mary importance. The measurements presented here are a snapshot of Titan’s upper atmosphere at a particular altitude, latitude and local time. We analyzed the T5 INMS ion spectra obtained at clos- est approach (1027–1200 km) but measurements were obtained with a good signal to noise ratio up to 1600 km (Cravens et al., 2006). Above 1200 km, diffusion cannot be neglected and de- veloping a one-dimensional photochemical model is required in order to retrieve altitude profiles for the neutral species pre- sented here. Such profiles should shed some light on the altitude of formation of the species and consequently on their formation processes. Finally, analysis of more recent flybys obtained at a different latitude and/or solar zenith angle will provide some in- formation on the dynamics and energy deposition processes in Titan’s upper atmosphere.
