Its main objective is to undertake actions intended to ensure that economic resources of Joanna Małecka, Teresa Łuczka, Jarmila Šebestová, Roman Šperka48 individual companies are coordinated in a pragmatic and productive manner. Entrepre- neurship may be considered in two respects: (1) processes – activities aimed at forming and building a new company in certain conditions, with a view to generating profits, or (2) a set of traits and personalities – describing a particular human behaviour and ac- tion focused on innovation, ability to accept changes, spot opportunities, and take ri- sks. Regardless of the multitude of definitions in the related literature, there is no doubt that in most cases the combination of these two economic and social components deter- mines possible business success. Poles more and more frequently perceive the oppor- tunities offered through the establishment of own business. Up to 63% of the public at large holds this view, placing Poland at the forefront among the European Union coun- tries in this regard. The article attempts to examine the socio-economic determinants of respondents which affect Poles’ willingness to set up their own businesses. Introduction Entrepreneurship is one of the manifold determinants of development of in- dividual national economies worldwide. In the related literature, entrepre- neurship is viewed as a process or a set of traits and personalities, depend- ing on which aspect is being analysed (Łuczka, 2002, pp. 29–49; Delmar, 2006, pp. 62– 87; Davidsonn et al., 2006, pp. 21–38; Glinka & Gudkova, 2011; Nowak & Praszkier, 2015; Zięba, 2016; see also: Naman & Slevin, 1993, pp. 137–153; O’Boyle et al., 2014, pp. 773–384). The analysis results presented in this article, concerning the issue being examined, are reflected in the attitude (willingness to undertake activity) that supports commencement of entrepreneurial oper- ations and creation of more jobs. In this regard, an attempt was also made to define respondents’ preferred development directions – entrepreneurial atti- tudes. This was done by referring to their experience and ability to draw mean- ingful conclusions, and translate and implement them in new companies, with account being taken of the location of company seats. Due to the scope of the authors’ scientific interests, special attention was paid to future micro- and small entrepreneurs. The issue of economic activity is extensively discussed in the related lit- erature in various aspects of company development, in particular that of SME growth (O’Farrell & Hitchens, 1988, pp. 1365–1383; Bielawska, 1992, pp. 463– 468; Łuczka, 2013; Małecka, 2016a, pp. 91–122; Wasilczuk, 2015, pp. 13– 25; see also: O’Brien, 1984, pp. 25–62). The ongoing transformation of traditional economies into knowledge-based economies is one such research area (Kuźniar, 2010, pp. 249–258). Rail transport and telephone have made the world considerably smaller, but the invention, notably popularisation, of the computer, satellite communications, wireless phones and the Internet has EConomiC aCtivity and soCial dEtErminants… 49 influenced primarily the lifestyles of individual communities, cultural condi- tions and, consequently, existing organisations. Entrepreneurship considered as the ability to survive and succeed in business also depends, to a large ex- tent, on developed capabilities of continuous learning. A learning organisation, in turn, has competitive advantage based on knowledge, competences, capa- bilities, creativity, intelligence, imagination, motivation, (etc.), and a system of values of its team members. It is the knowledge about key processes, products or markets that may be the most constructive element of a company. There- fore, strategic decisions may be said to include arrangements on how to use and share existing corporate knowledge, acquisition of new knowledge, and efforts to improve company competitiveness and innovative capacity (see also: Naman & Slevin, 1993, pp. 137–153; Šebestová, 2016, pp. 177–189). The word literature on this topic, as well as the functioning of economies, is influenced by internationalisation, globalisation and innovation (see: Mc Dou- gall, 1989, pp. 387–400; Hennart, 2014, pp. 117–135; Wach, 2015, pp. 9–24; Małecka, 2016b, pp. 117–129). Today, when talking about entrepreneurship, the question of whether to undergo these processes does not arise. Instead, what matters is how to achieve such a status most efficiently. The previous “wheth- er” has been replaced by “how”. Each of the issues examined against the so- cial, psychological or economic backdrop will find its characteristics within the area studied. The reason is that both intensified competition and pace of progress more and more frequently bring to light the importance of change, which is implemented more efficiently in flexible and agile enterprises devel- oping at the rate decided on by their leaders (Welch & Welch, 2005). These fea- tures are particularly characteristic of SMEs, which are becoming ever more willing and bolder to resort to capital market solutions (Łuczka, 2007; Małecka, 2015, pp. 39–54; Da Gbadji, Gailly, & Schwienbacher, 2015, pp. 1213–1245). In this respect, the determinants of development may include: (1) companies’ ability to learn and (2) continuity of the learning process in terms of both in- dividual companies and entire employee teams. The trend indicating a change in the perception of entrepreneurs in this regard has been visible for many years. Nonetheless, it adds a specific perspective and specific aspects to the assessment of entrepreneurial attitudes in the case of former centrally man- aged economies such as Poland, where the capital market has been in operation for only 27 years (Gilson & Black, 1998, pp. 243–277; Gompers & Lerner, 2001, pp. 145– 168; Małecka, 2016b, pp. 117–129). What then becomes vital is alloca- tion of the amounts for hiring highly qualified workers and paying their wages, Joanna Małecka, Teresa Łuczka, Jarmila Šebestová, Roman Šperka50 viewed by entrepreneurs as investment in their companies rather than costs (see: Łuczka, 2013). But will a person who has gained experience in one com- pany evaluate his or her competences and, as a future entrepreneur, offer an improved working environment to potential employees? Or will such a person tend to disseminate negative experiences – experiences that should be elimi- nated in any company, regardless of its size, so that the strategy of construc- tive development goes hand in hand with social awareness and responsibility of collectivities such as enterprises? The notion of conscious, innovative and learning society that flexibly adapts to changes relates equally to employees and employers. Human capital cannot be reproduced as fast as any other capi- tal, but negligence and mismanagement may very quickly lead to an outflow of the most valuable staff (Okoń-Horodyńska, 2009, p. 38). This is because what is becoming noticeable, in particular among small and medium-sized enterprises, is a change in attitudes of employees, who often begin to work for a company and leave it because they are dissatisfied with cooperation of the entrepreneur (owner/CEO) (preliminary finding from the authors’ own unpublished pilot re- search). An important element contributing to the advancement of efficient econom- ic operations is research and development (R&D) activities that, if undertaken systematically, supports entrepreneurship and increases knowledge, including knowledge about the human being, culture and society. Collections of knowl- edge resources so compiled allow for new challenges to be taken on, new appli- cations to be designed and development to be continued along the lines of the progress of the world economy. The article attempts to examine the respond- ents’ socio-economic determinants influencing Poles’ readiness to set up their businesses. Entrepreneurs make up the bulk of the middle class; therefore, they generally must share its fundamental principles, including social attitudes such as trust and social activity for the regions in which they operate. Research methodology and the research process The results presented are based on source data from annual reports and pub- lications that have been made available by capital market institutions and on the authors’ own research on Polish entrepreneurs. Having examined the issue of entrepreneurship among 238 respondents, the authors outline economic ac- tivity, with a focus on social determinants, by means of analyses, figures and comparisons. EConomiC aCtivity and soCial dEtErminants… 51 In order to calculate and present the findings in tables and figures, mathe- matical analysis tools were employed that allowed for determining: ■ the quantitative share, ■ the percentage value of shares to illustrate the examined structures in the studied aspects, ■ and outlining a trend analysis based on linear regression methods. The group administered questionnaire consisted of 44 questions on the perception of conditions for running own business activity among present and future entrepreneurs. The survey covered both men and women who had a common fundamental goal: to improve their skills to increase human capital in enterprises. The responses allowed an analysis of opportunities to access sources of financing of their own economic activity and indicated the social barriers most frequently encountered by respondents. Socio-economic determinants of entrepreneurship The progressing globalisation is exerting growing influence on internation- al activities of enterprises. Social determinants underlying entrepreneurship, which is apparently regarded by respondents as a process directly connect- ed with internationalisation of business operations, are playing an ever bigger role in choosing the type of economic activity or in deciding to switch to anoth- er type of business operations. In order to catch up with the rapidly changing market factors, entrepreneurs must also actively monitor the environment to maintain competitive advantage. In this perspective, the issue of innovation1 emerges. Considered with reference to three cases: (1) successful implemen- tation of innovation – successful activity, not necessarily in commercial terms, (2) innovation in the course of implementation, and (3) discontinued activity – withdrawal from innovation implementation, the question of innovation shows that social determinants may constitute a barrier to the development of compa- ny potential on a par with financial factors and legal regulations (OECD, 2008, pp. 31, 81). The study presents the concept of TPP innovation expanded to in- clude marketing and organisational innovation (table 1). 1 Oslo Methodology defines an innovative company as one that introduced at least one product or process innovation (as implementation or improvement) within the pe- riod examined (mostly three years).

EConomiC aCtivity and soCial dEtErminants… 53 OECD findings confirm the authors’ own research results revealing that de- spite considering the use of capital market and private equity solutions, entre- preneurs still perceive raising capital in this way as a significant barrier to de- velopment (Małecka & Łuczka, 2016a, pp. 93–110; Małecka & Łuczka, 2016b, pp. 418–431; see also: Gregory et al., 2005, pp. 382–392). From the point of view of determinants of SME capital structure, a corre- lation between company size and capital structure should be stressed – the smaller the company, the greater the ownership share. Accordingly, as the en- terprise grows, access to sources of financing, in particular investment financ- ing for innovation and development, gains importance. The reason is that SMEs still commonly face credit discrimination pointed out by J.K. Galbraith, which can be replaced by capital market solutions (Galbraith, 1957; Galbraith, 1983, pp. 63–77; see also: Beck et al., 2006, pp. 1–36; Bielawska, 2011, pp. 264–272; Łuczka, 2013; Šebestová, Šperka, & Čemerková, 2016, pp. 65–74). Socio-economic determinants of entrepreneurship in the light of empirical research SMEs are a source of structural changes in national economies and set the framework for socio-economic development, thus directly impacting on the world economy (Bass, 2006, pp. 10–11), as well as on basic macroeconomic in- dicators (see: Grzywacz, 2012; Jaworski, 2011, pp. 161–176). The most impor- tant factors affecting economic activity are demand considerations. They both influence development and push or limit innovation of activities pursued by entrepreneurs. Demand is a driver of improvement of existing and develop- ment of new products. It allows companies to modify and diversify their of- fer portfolios in order to boost sales and increase their market share. Demand factors motivate entrepreneurs to refine production processes, enhance qual- ity of services, reduce supply costs and, consequently, optimise prices. These are the factors that drive innovation implementation in enterprises. Market factors condition the commercial success of individual products, technologies and services, setting the direction of changes in each area of the economy and life of individual populations. The reason is that the distance from academic, scientific and cultural centres has a significant impact on entrepreneurship, in particular on traits and personalities of entrepreneurs. They may also deter- mine whether companies in certain sectors will be interested in the integra- tion of innovation in their own development strategies. Among other things, Joanna Małecka, Teresa Łuczka, Jarmila Šebestová, Roman Šperka54 entrepreneurship implies timely perception of development opportunities and chances, perception that may be a crucial reason behind companies’ decisions to refrain from engaging in a new innovative activity when they do not believe that the existing demand is sufficient to ensure satisfactory profitability of new products/ services. Failure to take advantage of the market situation and introduce innovation by a company with considerable experience in switching between types of market activities is exemplified by Nokia2, which, the world leader once, has disappeared from the market within a few years. It may there- fore be safely hypothesized that entrepreneurship, considered in two aspects: (1) processes – activities aimed at forming and building a new company in certain conditions, with a view to generating profits, or (2) a set of traits and personalities – describing a particular human behaviour and action focused on innovation, ability to accept changes, spot opportunities and take risks, ei- ther drives company growth or, conversely, company growth is an effect of en- trepreneurship of company managers (Galbraith, 1957; see: Davidsson et al., 2006, pp. 932–952) who, in turn, represent values and merits resulting from social factors and attitudes. The authors’ own research was aimed at examining the relationships among respondents, chiefly their entrepreneurial attitudes and prospects for 2 Nokia was founded in 1865 by Fredrik Idestam. Initially, it operated as a pulp mill in Finland. In the late 19th century, Nokia entered the rubber industry (rubber boots, car tires), which it abandoned for the sake of electrification of houses and facto- ries (1912). At that time, Finnish Cable Works was set up and production of cables for telegraphs and telephones commenced. The story of Nokia Corporation begins in 1967. It was formed as a result of merger of Finnish Rubber Works with Finnish Cable Works. In 1979, Nokia went into a joint venture with television maker Salora to create Mobira Oy, launched the world’s first mobile telephony network (NMT), and developed its first mobile phone. Is in the 1980s, it became the global market leader with its most famous game – Snake. In 1998, it was still the world mobile telephony leader. The crisis came in 2007 with the advent of iPhone and Android devices that were misjudged by Nokia’s market research and qualified as non-competition. Nokia mobile phones ceased to sell in 2009, and the corporation recorded a loss for the first time. Demand shifted towards smartphones, and Nokia was too far behind to catch up with competitors. On the verge of bankruptcy, it made a partnership with Microsoft and launched Windows Phone (Lu- mia) in 2011. However, profits could not improve its financial condition. The corpora- tion was acquired by Microsoft in April 2014 and repurchased by Faxcom in May 2016. Currently, it designs navigation maps (Here) and develops other telecommunications technologies without much success. The world leader disappeared from the market be- cause it had not innovated.

Urban areas are most frequently indicated as locations where a business can be developed, with only 8.5% of those surveyed opting for rural areas. Detailed analysis of data has shown that most respondents started busi- nesses of the same size as those where they gained their initial experience. Only one seventh of micro-entrepreneurs wish to become small or medium-sized en- trepreneurs. A fundamental division of small businesses was made by delineat- ing two sets: (1) companies employing from 10 to 19, and (2) from 20 to 49 peo- ple (table 2). Table 2.

In examining the perception and legitimacy of forms of employment, it was noted that most people who had ever worked under an employment contract would offer this form of employment to their potential new workers. What should be highlighted, however, is that one fifth of them would offer other legal forms (mandate or specific-task contract, self-employment) in order to avoid additional costs. These statistics look optimistic in the case of people who gained their experience under a legal relationship with the first employer oth- er than an employment contract. One fourth of them prefer other forms of em- ployment of future workers to an employment contract (table 3). Joanna Małecka, Teresa Łuczka, Jarmila Šebestová, Roman Šperka56 Table 3.

The analysis has revealed that the majority of future entrepreneurs focus on expansion to markets with greater geographic coverage than those where the entrepreneurs gained their first professional experience. 16.5% of them would like to raise their market share in their country, 7.5% within their region, and 2.0% wish to enhance cooperation with one of the neighbouring countries. It is worrying that despite the already gained experience in international trade, 8.5% of those surveyed would not consider trade with more than one foreign counterparty when starting their business (figure 1). Despite their competences, respondents stated that their decision to re- frain from international cooperation was primarily motivated by high costs of business operations arising from the need to cooperate with competent legal authorities that permit the signing of direct contracts as well as the need to make cash commitments in the initial period of cooperation. This form of finan- cial settlements has a straight-through bearing on company financial liquid- ity and can be a significant barrier to company development in the initial pe- riod of activity, when additional external sources of financing are unavailable. Thus, a social aspect appears that is associated with distrust as an often indi- cated factor directly determining company development. It was also found that 20.5% of respondents speak fluent English and can independently represent their companies abroad, while only 2.0 % speak German.

Nearly 50% of those surveyed speak and write communicative English, but do not feel sufficiently capable of negotiating contracts and entering into professional discussions on behalf of their enterprises, whereas this proportion stands at 19.5% for German (table 4). The authors believe that knowledge of a foreign language is one of the essential factors in entrepreneurs refraining from foreign cooperation, which dramatically reduces the oppor- tunities and prospects for success in the world of global competition. Another social as- pect, namely access to academic and research centres that provide opportunities for (1) learning languages and (2) increasing the prosperity of society allowing knowledge to be continued and expanded, appears to be a determinant of the development of economic ac- tivity.

Joanna Małecka, Teresa Łuczka, Jarmila Šebestová, Roman Šperka58 Conclusions Only steady economic growth accompanied by the development of enterprises ensures prosperity of a society. The importance and scale of the issue of linking economic activity to social determinants are extensive subjects of statistical research on the nature and consequences of entrepreneurship in various sec- tors of activity. This includes concepts, definitions and methodology followed in related literature, but also research of the Organisation for Economic Coop- eration and Development, which brings together 35 highly developed and dem- ocratic countries. Small and medium-sized enterprises are more specialised in their business. This means more efficient and effective operations, including the ability to smoothly and flexibly adapt to changing market conditions and switch between types of economic activity. Knowledge is exchanged more eas- ily within such enterprises, resulting in commercialisation and marketing ac- tivities. A factor determining SME development both in terms of international economic activity and innovation is finance, since internal financial resources are usually limited and access to external sources of financing is definitely con- strained, which is particularly true for funds for implementation of innovative projects, in comparison with large enterprises. SMEs continue to face a barrier called credit discrimination in both money and capital markets. In considering this issue, a vital role is played by infrastructure that supports: (1) establish- ing contacts with potential counterparties, (2) performing professional market analyses, (3) establishing cooperation with public research institutions. In the context of ever widespread globalisation, many factors that affect en- trepreneurship are of national or regional character. The focus then is not only on institutional factors that can both facilitate and effectively discourage co- operation but also on the culture and values. On the other hand, there is an in- ternational aspect, as neither technology nor knowledge knows borders. The Internet makes it possible to communicate and establish cooperation at every available level. This applies to the sphere of development as well as to opportu- nities to expand knowledge, follow competitors’ actions and conclude transac- tions. In this respect, globalisation is changing sectoral structures of national economies, forcing them to transform their institutional systems and develop new economic sectors, as confirmed by the authors’ own research based previ- ous experience in SME observation.
