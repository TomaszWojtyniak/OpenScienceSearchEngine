We present sufficient conditions under which, for a given solution y of the equation ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0, there exists a solution x of the nonlinear equation with the asymptotic behavior xn = yn + zn, where z is a sequence convergent to zero. Our approach allows us to control the degree of approximation, i.e., the rate of convergence of the sequence z. We examine two types of approximation: harmonic approximation when zn = o(n s), s ≤ 0, and geometric approximation when zn = o(µn), µ ∈ (0, 1). 1. INTRODUCTION Let N, R denote the set of positive integers and the set of real numbers, respectively. In this paper we consider the third order nonlinear difference equation of the form (E) ∆(rn∆(pn∆xn)) = anf(xσ(n)) + bn, ∗Corresponding author.

By a solution of (E) we mean a sequence x : N→ R satisfying (E) for large n. The purpose of this paper is to study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of equation (E), which means that we establish conditions under which, for a given solution y of the equation (1) ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0, there exists a solution x of (E) such that (2) xn = yn + o(1). If condition (2) is satisfied, then x is called a solution with prescribed asymptotic behavior, and y is called an approximative solution of (E). Using, in (2), a quickly converging to zero sequence we get a more precise approximation. Replacing (2) by xn = yn + o(n s) for a given s ∈ (−∞, 0], we obtain a harmonic approximation. Next, replacing (2) by xn = yn+o(µ n) for a given µ ∈ (0, 1), we obtain a geometric approximation. In our investigations the set of all solutions of equation (1) plays an important role. It is not difficult to see that a sequence y is a solution of (1) if and only if there exist c1, c2, c3 ∈ R such that yn = c1 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj j−1∑ i=1 1 ri + c2 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj + c3. We regard equation (E) as a generalization of the ordinary equation ∆3xn = anf(xσ(n)) + bn. Then equation (1) takes the form (3) ∆3yn = 0. From the point of view of asymptotic behavior, it is worth mentioning that there exist positive sequences r and p such that any solution of (1) is convergent. It is very different from case (3) for which only constant solutions are convergent. The considered problems appear in the study of asymptotic properties of solutions of both differential and difference equations. This study, in the case of second order differential equations, has been extensively conducted during the last five decades; see for example, the survey paper of Agarwal et al. [1] and the references therein. The considerations for equations of order higher than two have been given less attention in the literature, see [15], [23]. Philos et al. [22] proved sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of solutions of the equation x(m)(t) = f(t, x) with prescribed asymptotic behavior via the solution of y(m) = 0, which means that the solution x of nonlinear equations possesses the form x(t) = c0 + c1t+ . . .+ ckt k + o(1), as t→∞ Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 3 where k ∈ {1, . . . ,m− 1}. Asymptotically polynomial solutions were also studied in the discrete case. This subject was begun by Popenda and Drozdowicz [9] and [10]. In [9], asymp- totically linear solutions of difference equations of order two were studied. In [10], necessary and sufficient conditions were presented for the equation ∆mxn = anf(xn) to have a convergent solution (that, is asymptotically polynomial of degree zero). Zafer [25] obtained sufficient conditions for equation ∆mxn = f(n, xσ(n)) + bn to have a solution of the form xn = an m−1 + o(nm−1). In [16] and [21], the first author presented generalizations of these results. In these generalizations the “measure” of approximation was the space o(1). Further, in [17] and [18], were presented results, in which the “measure” of approximation is the space o(ns), where s ∈ (−∞, 0]. For some background on asymptotically polynomial solutions we refer to [17]. This paper is a continuation of these investigations. Motivation of our study was also the fact, that in the investigation of the third order trinomial differential equations of the form (4) y′′′(t) + a(t)y′(t) + b(t)F (y(τ(t))) = 0 a transformation of this equation to a binomial third order differential equation of type (E’) ( r(t) (p(t)x′(t)) ′ )′ = a(t)f (y(τ(t))) , is often applied, see [2], [4], [5] or [11]. Such a method was also used to the discrete counterpart of equation (4). For example, in [13] asymptotic properties of nonoscillatory solutions of the equation (5) ∆3xn + pn∆xn+1 + qnxn−τ = 0 were studied by transforming this equation to a binomial difference equation with quasi-differences of type (E). A criteria which ensures that all nonoscillatory solu- tions of (5) tend to zero was established. In [12], criteria for oscillation of bounded solutions and sufficient conditions for the existence of certain types of nonoscillatory solutions of nonlinear equation of type (5), are obtained. Here also the transforma- tion to a binomial difference equation with quasidifferences was used. Moreover, third order difference equations with quasi differences appear in the study of neutral type equations, see [6] or [24]. In these papers, the substitution which transforms a second order difference equation of neutral type to a third order non-neutral equa- tion with quasidifference, was applied. For some other asymptotic properties of solutions to third-order difference equations with quasi-differences, we refer to [3], [7], [8], [14]. 4 Janusz Migda, Ma lgorzata Migda, Magdalena Nockowska-Rosiak The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present some preliminary lemmas. Next, in Section 3, we present our theory of harmonic approximations. The main result of this section is presented in Theorem 1. Section 4 is devoted to geometric approximation. The main result of this section is Theorem 2. In the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 we use the Schauder type fixed point lemma from [18]. We present two examples which prove that the assumptions of the main theorems are essential. Moreover, we construct three examples which show how the presented theorems can be used. 2. PRELIMINARIES The space of all sequences x : N → R we denote by RN. If x, y in RN, then xy and |x| denotes the sequences defined by xy(n) = xnyn and |x|(n) = |xn|, respectively. Moreover, ‖x‖ = sup{|xn| : n ∈ N}. If u ∈ RN and m < n, then by convention, m∑ k=n uk = 0. Lemma 1. [20, Lemma 5] If U,W are positive sequences and ∞∑ k=1 Wk ∞∑ j=k Uj <∞, then ∞∑ k=1 Uk k∑ j=1 Wj <∞ and ∞∑ k=n Wk ∞∑ j=k Uj ≤ ∞∑ k=n Uk k∑ j=1 Wj for any n ∈ N. Lemma 2. Assume u : N→ R, s ∈ (−∞, 0], t1 ∈ [s,∞), t2 ∈ [s− t1,∞), 1 pn = O(nt1), 1 rn = O(nt2), τ = 3 + t1 + t2 − s, and lim inf k→∞ k ( |uk| |uk+1| − 1 ) > τ or lim inf k→∞ k log |uk| |uk+1| > τ. Then ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ui| <∞. Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 5 Proof. Using [19, Lemma 6.3, Lemma 6.4] we get that ∞∑ k=1 k2+t1+t2−s|uk| <∞. By the assumptions, we can choose a positive constant L such that p−1k ≤ Lk t1 for any k and r−1j ≤ Lj t2 for any j. Then ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ui| ≤ L2 ∞∑ k=1 kt1−s ∞∑ j=k jt2 ∞∑ i=j |ui| = L2 ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k kt1−sjt2 ∞∑ i=j |ui| ≤ L2 ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k jt1+t2−s ∞∑ i=j |ui| = L2 ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j jt1+t2−s|ui| ≤ L2 ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j it1+t2−s|ui|. Hence, by [18, Lemma 4.2] we get ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ui| ≤ L2 ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j i(i+ 1) 2 it1+t2−s|ui| ≤ L2 ∞∑ k=1 k2+t1+t2−s|uk| <∞. Lemma 3. [18, Lemma 4.7] Assume y, ρ : N→ R, and limn→∞ ρn = 0. In the set X = {x ∈ RN : |x− y| ≤ |ρ|} we define a metric by the formula (6) d(x, z) = ‖x− z‖. Then any continuous map H : X → X has a fixed point. 3. HARMONIC APPROXIMATION In this section we present sufficient conditions under which a given solution y of the equation ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0 is an approximative solution of (E). More precisely, we establish conditions for the existence of a solution x of equation (E) such that yn = xn + o(n s), where s ∈ (−∞, 0]. Recall that a sequence y : N→ R is a solution of the equation (7) ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0 6 Janusz Migda, Ma lgorzata Migda, Magdalena Nockowska-Rosiak if and only if there exist real constants c1, c2, c3 such that (8) yn = c1 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj j−1∑ i=1 1 ri + c2 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj + c3 for any n. Theorem 1. Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] and ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) <∞. Moreover, assume that q ∈ N, α ∈ (0,∞), y : N → R a solution of (7) are such that f is continuous and bounded on U , where U = ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α]. Then there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(n s). Proof. For n ∈ N and x ∈ RN, let x∗n = anf(xσ(n)) + bn. There exists a positive constant L, such that |f(t)| ≤ L for any t ∈ U . Let Y = {x ∈ RN : |x− y| ≤ α}, ρ ∈ RN, ρn = ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (L|ai|+ |bi|). Note that σ(n) ≥ q for large n. Hence, the sequence (f(xσ(n))) is bounded for any x ∈ Y . Therefore, ∞∑ k=1 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |x∗i | <∞ for any x ∈ Y . Define a sequence z by zn = ∞∑ k=n 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (L|ai|+ |bi|). By assumption, zn = o(1). Since s ≤ 0, we have (9) ∞∑ k=1 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (L|ai|+ |bi|) <∞. Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 7 Then n−s|ρn| = n−s ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (L|ai|+ |bi|) = ∞∑ k=n 1 nspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (L|ai|+ |bi|). Since s ≤ 0, we get n−s|ρn| ≤ ∞∑ k=n 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (L|ai|+ |bi|) = zn = o(1). Thus, ρn = n so(1) = o(ns). Hence, there exists an index p such that ρn ≤ α and σ(n) ≥ q for n ≥ p. Let X = {x ∈ RN : |x− y| ≤ ρ and xn = yn for n < p}, H : Y → RN, H(x)(n) = { yn for n < p, yn − ∑∞ k=n 1 pk ∑∞ j=k 1 rj ∑∞ i=j x ∗ i for n ≥ p. Note that X ⊂ Y . If x ∈ X, then for n ≥ p we have |H(x)(n)− yn| = ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j x∗i ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |x∗i | ≤ ρn. Therefore, HX ⊂ X. To prove the continuity of H, firstly we notice that because s ≤ 0, we have ∞∑ k=1 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ai| <∞, which implies ∞∑ k=1 |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi <∞ and ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ai| ≤ ∞∑ k=n |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi for any n ∈ N. Indeed, for Uj = 1rj ∑∞ i=j |ai|, ∞∑ k=1 1 pk ∞∑ j=k Uj = ∞∑ k=1 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ai| <∞. By Lemma 1, ∞∑ k=1 Uk k∑ j=1 1 pj <∞. 8 Janusz Migda, Ma lgorzata Migda, Magdalena Nockowska-Rosiak Hence, for Wk = 1 rk ∑k j=1 1 pj , we have ∞∑ k=1 Uk k∑ j=1 1 pj = ∞∑ k=1 1 rk ∞∑ i=k |ai| k∑ j=1 1 pj = ∞∑ k=1 Wk ∞∑ i=k |ai|. From Lemma 1 we get (10) ∞∑ k=1 |ak| k∑ i=1 1 ri i∑ j=1 1 pj = ∞∑ k=1 |ak| k∑ i=1 Wi <∞. Moreover, by Lemma 1, for any n ∈ N, ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ai| = ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k Uj ≤ ∞∑ k=n Uk k∑ j=1 1 pj = ∞∑ k=n Wk ∞∑ j=k |aj | ≤ ∞∑ k=1 |ak| k∑ j=1 Wj = ∞∑ k=n |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi .(11) Now, we can prove that H is continuous. Let x ∈ X, and ε > 0. By (10), ∞∑ k=1 |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi <∞. Choose an index m ≥ p and a positive constant γ such that (12) L ∞∑ k=m |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi < ε and γ m∑ k=1 |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi < ε. Let C = m⋃ n=1 [yσ(n) − α, yσ(n) + α]. Choose a positive δ such that if t1, t2 ∈ C and |t1 − t2| < δ, then |f(t1)− f(t2)| < γ. Choose z ∈ X such that ‖x− z‖ < δ. Then ‖Hx−Hz‖ = sup n≥p ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (x∗i − z ∗ i ) ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ ∞∑ k=p 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |x∗i − z ∗ i | ≤ ∞∑ k=p 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j |ai||f(xσ(i))− f(zσ(i))|. Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 9 Using (11) and (12) we get ‖Hx−Hz‖ ≤ ∞∑ k=p |ak||f(xσ(k))− f(zσ(k))| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi ≤ γ m∑ k=1 |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi + 2L ∞∑ k=m |ak| k∑ j=1 1 rj j∑ i=1 1 pi < 3ε. Hence, the map H : X → X is continuous with respect to the metric defined by (6). By Lemma 3, there exists a point x ∈ X such that x = Hx. Then, for n ≥ p, we have xn = yn − ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j x∗i . Hence, for n ≥ p we get ∆(rn∆(pn∆xn)) = ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn))−∆  rn∆  pn∆   ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j x∗i       = 0− (−x∗n) = anf(xσ(n)) + bn. Therefore, x is a solution of (E). Since x ∈ X and ρn = o(ns), we have xn = yn + o(n s). From Theorem 1 we obtain the following corollary. Corollary 1. Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0], t1 ∈ [s,∞), ∞∑ k=1 k2+t1+t2−s(|ak|+ |bk|) <∞, 1 pn = O(nt1), 1 rn = O(nt2), q ∈ N, α ∈ (0,∞), y : N→ R is a solution of (7), U = ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α], and f is continuous and bounded on U . Then there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(n s). Corollary 2. Assume f is continuous, s ∈ (−∞, 0] and ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) <∞. Then for any bounded solution y of the equation ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0 there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(n s). 10 Janusz Migda, Ma lgorzata Migda, Magdalena Nockowska-Rosiak Proof. Assume y is a bounded solution of the equation ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0 and U = ∞⋃ n=1 [yn − 1, yn + 1]. Since the sequence y is bounded, U is bounded. Hence f is continuous and bounded on U . Now, using Theorem 1, we obtain the result. Corollary 3. Assume f is continuous, s ∈ (−∞, 0] and ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) <∞. Then for any real constant c there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = c+o(n s). Proof. Obviously any constant sequence yn = c is a bounded solution of the equa- tion ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0. Hence the assertion is a consequence of Corollary 2. Corollary 4. Assume f is continuous and bounded, s ∈ (−∞, 0] and ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) <∞. Then for any solution y a of (7) there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(n s). Corollary 5. Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0], t1 ∈ [s,∞), t2 ∈ [s− t1,∞), 1 pn = O(nt1), 1 rn = O(nt2), lim inf k→∞ k ( |ak|+ |bk| |ak+1|+ |bk+1| − 1 ) > 3 + t1 + t2 − s, and f is continuous. Moreover, assume that y : N → R is a solution of (7) such that the sequence y is bounded or one of the following conditions holds (a) yn →∞ and lim sup τ→∞ |f(τ)| <∞, (b) yn → −∞ and lim sup τ→−∞ |f(τ)| <∞. Then there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(n s). Proof. If y is bounded, then by Lemma 2 and Corollary 2 we get the result. Assume condition (a) is satisfied. Then f is continuous and bounded on [0,∞). By Lemma 2 and Corollary 1, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(n s). The proof for case (b) is similar. Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 11 Now we present an example that proves the assumption that the function f is bounded on some “neighborhood” of y which solves ∆ (rn∆ (pn∆yn)) = 0 in Theorem 1, is essential. Example 1. Assume rn = 1 n , pn = n, an = 1 n4 √ n , bn = 0, σ(n) = n− 2, f(x) = x2. Then equation (E) takes the form (13) ∆ ( 1 n ∆ (n∆xn) ) = (xn−2) 2 √ nn4 . Let c1 = 1, c2 = c3 = 0. Define a sequence y by yn = c1 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj j−1∑ i=1 1 ri + c2 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj + c3 = n−1∑ j=1 1 j j−1∑ i=1 i = (n− 1)(n− 2) 4 . Notice that f is continuous and unbounded on ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α] for any q ∈ N and any α > 0. Let s = 0. Then ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) = ∞∑ k=1 1 k ∞∑ j=k j ∞∑ i=j 1 √ i i4 = ∞∑ k=1 1 k ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j j √ i i4 ≤ ∞∑ k=1 1 k ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j i √ i i4 = ∞∑ k=1 1 k ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j 1 √ i i3 ≤ ∞∑ k=1 1 k ∞∑ j=k j √ j j3 = ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k 1 k 1 √ j j2 ≤ ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k 1 √ j j2 ≤ ∞∑ k=1 1 √ k k <∞. Assume x is a solution of (13) such that (14) xn = yn + zn, zn = o(n s) = o(1). Notice that xn →∞. Since ∆ ( 1 n ∆(n∆yn) ) = 0, 12 Janusz Migda, Ma lgorzata Migda, Magdalena Nockowska-Rosiak we have ∆ ( 1 n ∆(n∆zn) ) = ∆ ( 1 n ∆(n∆xn) ) = (xn−2) 2 √ nn4 > 0 for large n. Therefore, the sequence n−1∆(n∆zn) is eventually increasing, and there exists the limit λ = lim n→∞ 1 n ∆(n∆zn) > −∞. If λ =∞, then for large n we get ∆(n∆zn) > n. Summing up the above inequality from n0 to n− 1 gives n∆zn − n0∆zn0 > n− n0. Hence, lim inf n→∞ ∆zn ≥ 1. On the other hand, ∆zn = ∆o(1) = o(1). Therefore, we get λ < ∞. Thus, the series ∞∑ n=1 ∆ ( 1 n ∆(n∆zn) ) is convergent. On the other hand, ∆ ( 1 n ∆(n∆zn) ) = ∆ ( 1 n ∆(n∆xn) ) = (xn−2) 2 √ nn4 for large n. Taking into account that yn → ∞ and zn → 0, from (14) we get xn > yn/2 for large n. Hence, there exists an index n0 such that ∞∑ n=n0 ∆ ( 1 n ∆(n∆zn) ) > ∞∑ n=n0 ((n− 3)(n− 4))2 16 √ nn4 =∞ which gives a contradiction. � In the next example, we show that the assumption ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) <∞ in Theorem 1 is essential. Example 2. Assume rn = n, pn = n 4, an = 1 n , bn = 0, f(x) = √ |x|+ 1, σ : N→ N. Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 13 Then equation (E) takes the form (15) ∆ ( n∆ ( n4∆xn )) = √ |xσ(n)|+ 1 n . Let c1, c2, c3 ∈ R. Define a sequence y by yn = c1 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj j−1∑ i=1 1 ri + c2 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj + c3. It is easy to see that the sequence y is bounded. Define a sequence R by Rn = n−1∑ k=1 1 rk . Thus, ∆yn = p −1 n (c1Rn + c2). It is clear, that the sequence c1Rn + c2 has constant sign for large n. Since pn > 0, we get that y is eventually monotonic, and hence convergent. Hence, f is continuous and bounded on ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α] for any q ∈ N and any positive α. Let s = −4. Then, ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) = ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k 1 j ∞∑ i=j 1 i =∞. Assume x is a solution of (15) such that xn = yn + zn, zn = o(n s) = o(n−4). Since ∆(n∆(n4∆yn)) = 0, we have for large n (16) ∆(n∆(n4∆zn)) = ∆(n∆(n 4∆xn)) = √ |xσ(n)|+ 1 n > 1 n > 0. Therefore, the sequence n∆(n4∆zn) is eventually increasing and there exists the limit λ = lim n→∞ n∆(n4∆zn) > −∞. If λ <∞, then the series ∞∑ n=1 ∆(n∆(n4∆zn)) is convergent which is contrary to (16). Hence, λ =∞ and we get (17) ∆(n4∆zn) > 1 n 14 Janusz Migda, Ma lgorzata Migda, Magdalena Nockowska-Rosiak for large n. On the other hand, n4∆zn = n 4∆(o(n−4)) = n4o(n−4) = o(1). Hence, the series ∞∑ n=1 ∆(n4∆zn) is convergent. In view of (17) this is impossible. � The following two examples illustrate Theorem 1. Example 3. Assume s ∈ (−2/3, 0], rn = 1, pn = n, bn = 0, σ(n) = n, an = 2 3 √ n2 − 1 3 √ n(n+ 1)(n+ 2)(n+ 3) , f(x) = 1 3 √ x for x 6= 0. Then equation (E) takes the form (18) ∆2 (n∆xn) = 2 3 √ n2 − 1 3 √ n(n+ 1)(n+ 2)(n+ 3) 1 3 √ xn for xn 6= 0. Let c1 = c2 = c3 = 1. Then by (8) the sequence yn = n is a solution of (7). We have ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) = ∞∑ k=1 1 ksk ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j 2 3 √ i2 − 1 3 √ i(i+ 1)(i+ 2)(i+ 3) ≤ 2 ∞∑ k=1 1 ksk ∞∑ j=k ∞∑ i=j 1 3 √ i8 ≤ 2 ∞∑ k=1 1 ksk 3 √ k2 <∞. Let q = 2, α = 1, and U = ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α] = [1,∞). Since f is bounded and continuous on U , by Theorem 1, there exists a solution x of (18) such that xn = n+ o(n s). Indeed the sequence xn = n− 1n is a solutions of (18) with this property. Example 4. Assume rn = 2 n, pn = 2 −n, an = −3 · 2n−4 (1 + 2n)2 , bn = 0, σ(n) = n, f(x) = x 2. Then equation (E) takes the form (19) ∆ ( 2n∆ ( 1 2n ∆xn )) = −3 · 2n−4 (1 + 2n)2 x2n. Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 15 Let c1 = c2 = 0, c3 = 1. Then by (8) the sequence yn = 1 is a solution of (7). Let s ∈ (−∞, 0]. We have ∞∑ k=1 1 kspk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j (|ai|+ |bi|) = 3 ∞∑ k=1 1 ks 2k ∞∑ j=k 1 2j ∞∑ i=j 2i−4 (1 + 2i)2 ≤ 3 ∞∑ k=1 1 ks 2k ∞∑ j=k 1 2j ∞∑ i=j 1 2i+4 = 3 8 ∞∑ k=1 1 ks 2k ∞∑ j=k 1 4j = 1 2 ∞∑ k=1 1 ks 1 2k <∞. Hence, by Corollary 2, there exists a solution x of (19) such that xn = 1 + o(n s). Indeed the sequence xn = 1 + 1 2n is a solutions of (19) with this property. 4. GEOMETRIC APPROXIMATION In this section, we obtain results analogous to those in Section 3. We replace harmonic approximation by geometric approximation which means with measure of approximation o(µn), µ ∈ (0, 1). We will use the following condition: (G) t ∈ R, p−1n = O(nt), r−1n = O(nt), and lim sup n→∞ n √ |an|+ |bn| < µ < 1. Lemma 4. Assume u ∈ RN, t ∈ R, p−1n = O(nt), r−1n = O(nt), and λ = lim sup n→∞ n √ |un| < µ < 1. Then ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j ui = o(µ n). Proof. Note that if β ∈ (0, 1), then (20) ∞∑ i=j βi = βj 1− β . Moreover, if 0 < α < β, then (21) k √ ktαk = ( k √ k )t α < β ⇒ ktαk < βk 16 Janusz Migda, Ma lgorzata Migda, Magdalena Nockowska-Rosiak for large k. Choose β1, β2, β3 such that λ < β1 < β2 < β3 < µ, and let zn = ∞∑ k=n 1 pk ∞∑ j=k 1 rj ∞∑ i=j ui. Choose positive constants L1, L2 such that p −1 n ≤ L1nt and r−1n ≤ L2nt for any n. Then, using (20) and reasoning as in (21), we get |zn| ≤ L1L2 ∞∑ k=n kt ∞∑ j=k jt ∞∑ i=j |ui| < L1L2 ∞∑ k=n kt ∞∑ j=k jt ∞∑ i=j βi1 = L1L2 1− β1 ∞∑ k=n kt ∞∑ j=k jtβ j 1 < L1L2 1− β1 ∞∑ k=n kt ∞∑ j=k β j 2 = L1L2 (1− β1)(1− β2) ∞∑ k=n ktβk2 < L1L2β n 3 (1− β1)(1− β2)(1− β3) for large n. Hence zn = O(β n 3 ) = o(µ n). Theorem 2. Assume (G) holds, q ∈ N, α ∈ (0,∞), y : N → R is a solution of (7), U = ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α], and f is continuous and bounded on U . Then there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(µ n). Proof. Repeat the proof of Theorem 1 using Lemma 4. Corollary 6. Assume (G) holds and f is continuous. Then for any bounded so- lution y of the equation ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0 there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(µ n). Corollary 7. Assume (G) holds and f is continuous and bounded. Then for any solution y of the equation ∆(rn∆(pn∆yn)) = 0 there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(µ n). The following example illustrates Theorem 2. Asymptotic properties of solutions of third order difference equations 17 Example 5. Assume f(x) = x4 for x ∈ R, rn = 1 n , an = 4 −n, σ(n) = n− 3, for n ∈ N, t = 1, µ ∈ (4−1, 1), pn = { 1 for n = 1, n2(n2 − 1) for n ≥ 2, bn =   0 for n < 4, 3 64 4−n ( −9n3 + 21n2 + 28n− 4− 1 12 ( n−5 n−3 + 4 −n+4 )4) for n ≥ 4. Then equation (E) takes the form (22) ∆ ( 1 n ∆ (pn∆xn) ) = (xn−3) 4 4n + bn. Notice that lim sup n→∞ n √ |an|+ |bn| = 14 < µ. Let c1, c2, c3 ∈ R. Define a sequence y by yn = c1 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj j−1∑ i=1 1 ri + c2 n−1∑ j=1 1 pj + c3. Then, for n ≥ 2, we have yn = c1 4 ( 1− 2 n ) + c2 n−1∑ j=2 1 j2(j2 − 1) + c2 + c3. Hence, the sequence y is convergent and, by Corollary 6, there exists a solution x of (22) such that xn = yn + o(µ −n). If c1 = 1, c2 = c3 = 0, then one of such solutions is xn = 1 2 ( 1 2 − 1 n ) + 4−n. � Acknowledgments.
