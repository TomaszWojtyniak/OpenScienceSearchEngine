The objective of this study was to investigate possible changes in soil and water chemistry in Grand County, Colorado in response to the epidemic, and to identify major controlling influences on stream-water nutrients and C in areas affected by the mountain pine beetle. Soil moisture and soil N increased in soils beneath trees killed by the mountain pine beetle, reflecting reduced evapotranspiration and litter accumulation and decay. No significant changes in stream-water NO�3 or dissolved organic C were observed; however, total N and total P increased, possibly due to litter breakdown or increased pro- ductivity related to warming air temperatures. Multiple-regression analyses indicated that % of basin affected by mountain pine beetles had minimal influence on stream-water NO�3 and dissolved organic C; instead, other basin characteristics, such as percent of the basin classified as forest, were much more important.

Introduction The mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) is the primary cause of insect-induced mortality in pine forests in western North America (Gibson, 2004). In northern Colorado and southern Wyoming, pine forests are experiencing the most severe MPB epidemic in recorded history, with 70–90% mortality of lodge- pole (Pinus contorta), limber (Pinus flexilis), and Ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) pines on 1.62 million ha (4 million acres) since 1996 (Raffa et al., 2008; http://csfs.colostate.edu/, accessed 2/3/2011). Contributing factors include an abundance of mature, dense lodgepole forests, drought stress, and warming temperatures, which have allowed the MPB to expand its elevation and latitudi- nal ranges into areas formerly too cold for the beetle to survive (Carroll et al., 2004). MPB epidemics typically are stopped only by exhaustion of food supply (live trees) or extended periods of cold temperatures (<�30 to �40 �C), which can kill MPB larvae (Carroll et al., 2004). Winter minimum temperatures in western North America have increased substantially since the late 1970s (Easterling et al., 1997), and these increases correlate with range expansion for a variety of insects (Carroll et al., 2004). The short- and long-term effects of MPB-induced tree mortality on water quality could be profound. Pine needles and twigs, which Ltd. : +1 303 236 4912. are relatively rich in nitrogen (N), will decay relatively quickly (Fig. 1; Pearson et al., 1987). Branches and trunks, which have much lower concentrations of N, but substantial carbon (C), will decay more slowly (Fig. 1; Pearson et al., 1987). Much of the N and C released will accumulate in litter and soil, or be taken up by new forest growth (Vitousek and Melillo, 1979). An unknown fraction of N and C will leach into soil solution or groundwater, and may subsequently be transported to surface water. The quality of drinking-water supplies for communities in the Denver-Fort Collins area could be strongly impacted by the MPB (Ciesla, 2009). The Colorado-Big Thompson project stores water on the western slope of the Continental Divide in the ‘‘Three Lakes’’ system (Grand Lake, Shadow Mountain reservoir and Granby reser- voir) and diverts it to the eastern side through a network of tunnels (Fig. 2). A USDA Forest Service report states that the Three Lakes area is ‘‘at the epicenter of the current MPB outbreak,’’ and notes the possibility of increasing nutrient and sediment fluxes to the Three Lakes system, where eutrophication is a major concern (Ciesla, 2009). Increasing concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC) are possible as well, which could lead to increased produc- tion of possible carcinogenic disinfection by-products during water treatment (http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/publications_pages/ thm.pdf; accessed 1/25/2011). During 2007–2008, the US Geological Survey (USGS), in cooper- ation with the USDA Forest Service, conducted a study in Grand County, Colorado, to document possible changes in soil chemistry http://csfs.colostate.edu/ http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/publications_pages/thm.pdf http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/publications_pages/thm.pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2011.03.096 mailto:dwclow@usgs.gov http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2011.03.096 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08832927 http://www.elsevier.com/locate/apgeochem 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 C r el ea se (k g ha -1 y r-1 ) N r el ea se (k g ha -1 y r-1 ) years since beginning of infestation Current N deposition N C 0 Fig. 1.

The study approach in- volved (1) soil chemistry sampling under trees in three stages of MPB attack, including live ‘‘green-phase’’ trees, dead ‘‘red-phase’’ trees, and dead ‘‘gray-phase’’ trees (defined below); (2) synoptic water-quality sampling from streams draining basins with varying intensity and timing of MPB attack, (3) multiple-regression model- ing to characterize the relative importance of MPB-induced mortal- ity and basin characteristics in controlling stream-water NO3 and DOC concentrations, and (4) analysis of trends in stream-water nutrient and C concentrations during 2001–2009 at the largest nat- ural inflows to the Three Lakes system. 2. Methods Soil samples were collected during October 2008 at 11 sites, un- der 4–6 trees per site. Each tree was categorized as green-phase (healthy or freshly attacked by MPB), red-phase (1–3 years post- attack, retaining 50–100% needles), or gray-phase (P4 years post-attack; no needles). Three 15 cm deep soil cores of the A hori- zon were collected per tree, halfway between the bole and the edge of the canopy, in the north, SE and SW compass directions from the bole. Soil samples from under each tree were composited and analyzed for soil moisture, available N, extractable NH4, and extractable NO3 as in Rhoades et al. (2008). Soil chemistry under trees in green, red and gray-phases was compared by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey multiple-range test (Helsel and Hirsch, 1992). Two to 6 water samples were collected during the 2007 snow- melt period from each of 14 headwater streams, which were selected based on availability of historical streamflow and water- quality data (Fig. 2). Water samples were analyzed for dissolved and total N, DOC, and major dissolved constituents using standard USGS methods (Fishman, 1993). Basin boundaries upstream from each of the water-quality sampling sites were delineated, and the % of basin affected by MPB in individual years during 1996–2007 (%MPB) was quantified for each basin based on digital annual Aer- ial Detection Survey maps available from the U.S. Forest Service and Colorado State Forest Service (http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/gis/; ac- cessed 1/25/2011). Basin characteristics, including relief, slope, area, elevation, %forest, and annual precipitation were derived for each basin using the USGS StreamStats program (http://water.- usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/colorado.html; accessed 1/25/2011). Stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) equations were developed for stream-water NO3 and DOC concentrations; average NO3 and DOC from the 2007 stream synoptics were used as depen- dent variables, and %MPB and basin characteristics were used as explanatory variables. The variable that explained the most vari- ance in the chemical variable entered the model first. The variances explained by the remaining explanatory variables were recalcu- lated, and the variable that explained the next greatest amount of variance entered the model next. This iterative process was re- peated until no additional variables showed statistically significant correlations to the dependent chemical variable at p 6 0.1 (see Clow et al. (2010) for details). DOC was log transformed prior to model development to normalize the input data. Trends in stream-water chemistry during 2001–2009 were evaluated for three major inlets to the Three Lakes system (East In- let, North Inlet, and Arapaho Creek) using the Seasonal Kendall Test (SKT), as described in Helsel and Hirsch (1992). The SKT accounts for seasonality by testing for trends in each season and then com- bining the results. It can be applied to raw and flow-adjusted data, allowing one to account for variations in chemistry attributable to variations in flow. Historical data for the trend analyses were pulled from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS; http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis), and included major dissolved constituents, total N and total P. 3. Results 3.1. Soil chemistry Soil moisture was greater in soils under red- and gray-phase trees than under green-phase trees, probably due to reduced evapotranspiration (Fig. 3a). Available soil N was lowest in soils under green-phase trees and highest under gray-phase trees (Fig. 3b). These results are consistent with release of N from decay- ing litter and incorporation of that N into soil organic matter. Extractable ammonium (NH4) was greatest in soils under red- phase trees (Fig. 3c). Extractable NO3 was significantly higher in soils under red- and gray-phase trees than under green-phase trees (Fig. 3d). These results are consistent with mineralization of organ- ic N in decaying plant litter to NH4, followed by nitrification to NO3 (Griffin et al., 2011). Part of the increase in soil NO3 and soil mois- ture was probably due to reduced uptake of nutrients and water associated with MPB-induced mortality, despite increased rates of uptake by young, fast-growing trees nearby whose growth may have been stimulated by increased nutrient, water and light availability. 3.2. Water chemistry At all of the 2007 synoptic stream sampling sites, NO3 and DOC concentrations showed a pattern of increasing concentrations on the rising limb of the snowmelt hydrograph and decreasing con- centrations during the falling limb, as exemplified by Arapaho Creek, which is the largest natural inflow to the Three Lakes system (Fig. 4). This seasonal pattern is typical of high-elevation, headwa- ter catchments in Colorado and reflects flushing of solutes from the soil by snowmelt, and in the case of NO3, preferential elution from the snowpack (Campbell et al., 1995). Nitrate and DOC concentrations showed substantial spatial var- iation as well (Fig. 5). Percentage forest in the basins was the stron- gest predictor of spatial variations in stream-water NO3 and DOC concentrations. Nitrate was negatively related to %forest (adjusted r2 = 0.79) and log DOC was positively related to %forest (adjusted r2 = 0.50). The inverse relationship between NO3 and %forest may be explained by the uptake of NO3 by vegetation and soil microbes in forested areas. In contrast, the positive relationship between DOC and %forest probably reflects leaching of organic C from forest soils during snowmelt and storm events (Boyer et al., 1997). http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/gis/ http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/colorado.html http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/colorado.html http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis Fig. 2.

Multiple-regression modeling Several MLR models were evaluated for stream-water NO3, and the best model, based on highest adjusted r2 and lowest root mean square error, included %forest and basin relief as explanatory vari- ables.

The best DOC model included %forest, annual precipitation, north-facing slopes greater than 30%, and basin area, and explained 82% of the variance in DOC data (Fig. 6b). Precipitation was posi- tively related to DOC, probably reflecting the relationship between productivity and precipitation in the study area, where forest growth tends to be water limited. Basin area also was positively re- lated to DOC, perhaps because larger basins tend to have more wetlands. The negative relationship between DOC and steep, north-facing slopes may reflect low productivity in this environ- ment due to cold micro-climatic conditions and persistent snowfields. The input variables selected by the stepwise MLR procedure were not unique in their predictive ability, and some slightly less powerful model variants included %MPB in individual years as sig- nificant explanatory variables.

Trends in stream-water chemistry There were strong downward trends in raw and flow-adjusted NO3 and PO4 concentrations in each of the main inlets to the Three Lakes system during 2001–2009 (Table 1). Some of the decline in NO3 and PO4 might reflect recovery from drought conditions that induced high dissolved nutrient concentrations during the early part of the record, although the lack of trends in most major solutes indicates the drought effect was small. In contrast with the trends in dissolved nutrients, total N and total P, which include particulate and dissolved phases, increased in the inlet streams (Table 1). These contrasting trends might reflect increased conversion of dissolved nutrients to particulate form by benthic algae (increased productivity). This is consistent with warming temperatures that have been documented for the 1986–2007 period in northern Colorado (Clow, 2010). Alternatively, the increases in total N and total P could be due to an increase in fluxes of particulate organic matter to surface waters, as might be expected from breakdown of litter derived from trees killed by the MPB. 4. Discussion The significant increases in available N and extractable NH4 and NO3 observed in soil beneath trees killed by the MPB indicate a substantial shift in soil nutrient chemistry in response to the MPB epidemic. However, the increases in soil N were not reflected in stream-water chemistry. The apparent lack of response in stream-water chemistry is intriguing, and could be due to a variety %Forest 0 .2 %Forest Precipitation N.Slopes>30% Basin Area 0 Scaled Coefficients Scaled Coefficients Relief tion.

William Lewis and James McCutchan (University of Colorado, Boulder; pers. comm., 2011) have suggested several possible explanations: (1) spatial and temporal heterogeneity in MPB-induced tree mortality causes a damped response over time; (2) most MPB-induced tree mortality occurs on xeric hill slopes, where leaching of nutrients from soil to groundwater tends to be delayed; and (3) uptake of NO3 by remaining young trees, shrubs, and grasses reduces potential increases in stream-water NO3. Although stream-water NO3 concentrations have not increased in response to the MPB, total N and total P concentrations have in- creased, which may have important implications for drinking- water quality in the Three Lakes system. The MPB epidemic reached its peak in the Three Lakes basin during 2006–2008, and much of the associated litter is just beginning to accumulate and decay. Additional inputs of nutrients from litter decay to soils are likely, but it will take time for nutrients to be transported through soils and groundwater to aquatic ecosystems. Increases in surface water NO3 and DOC might still occur in response to MPB-induced tree mortality, although the changes are likely to be subtle and gradual in nature.
