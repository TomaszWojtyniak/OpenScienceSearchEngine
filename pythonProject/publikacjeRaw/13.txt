Introduction The main problem regarding the practice of conducting research on family entrepreneurship is the difficulty in obtaining large samples. The disadvantage of using small samples is the inadequacy of the results obtained with respect to general populations from which the sample was drawn. The indicated problem is not specific to the issue of family entrepreneurship, but in this area of knowledge it is extremely intense. This is due to entrepreneurs' reluctance to disclose sensitive information about their families (Winter et al., 1998), especially about family secrets (Schulze et al., 2001), not considering family criteria in public statistics such as COMPUSTAT or EUROSTAT, or low response from surveys conducted in family enterprises (Stamm and Lubiński, 2011). The problem of small sample sizes applies to family entrepreneurship researchers regardless of the quantitative research methodology adopted. This applies both to classical studies with the statistical inference procedure as well as the use of several alternative methods, such as artificial neural networks (Scott, 2005; Trinkle and Baldwin, 2016; Rojek at al., 2017), fuzzy logic (Melin et al., 2017; Seifollahi and Reza, 2016; 2017), rough set theory (Cai and Silva, 2016; Hegazi, 2015), analysis of data from social research (Ban at al., 2015; Sabokbar et al., 2016). The reason for this is the lack of adequate methodological instruments, which would allow family entrepreneurship researchers to undertake research on small samples, the results of which can be induced on the whole population while maintaining an adequately high confidence level. The importance of the problem of sample size in family entrepreneurship research is often indicated in source literature (Kung and Wen, 2007; Donckels and Fröhlich, 1991; Allouche, Amann, Jaussaud, and Kurashina, 2008; Owen and Winter, 1991; Barnes and Hershon, 1989; Welsch, 1991; Zellweger, 2007; Zellweger et al., 2011; Carrasco-Hernandez and Sánchez-Marin, 2007). This validity is both substantive and economic. Although the problem outlined above is important, it has not yet been widely discussed. Only a few articles dealing with the problem of sample size in research on family entrepreneurship are known (De Massis and Kotlar, 2014; Comi and Eppler, 2014; Więcek-Janka and Mierzwiak, 2015; Więcek-Janka; Mierzwiak and Kijewska, 2015; Więcek-Janka, Mierzwiak, and Kijewska, 2016; Więcek-Janka, Mierzwiak, and Kijewska, 2016b). The present article is intended to fill, if only in a fragmentary way, the existing shortage. The purpose of the study is to propose a set of tools that provide the opportunity to conduct research on the phenomenon of family entrepreneurship with the use of small samples while maintaining the analogous reliability of the obtained results as in the case of large samples. The proposed tools are the set of instruments of gray system theory (GST). The research hypothesis verified in this paper was formulated as follows, inference from a small amount of data related to the causes of conflicts using GST methods is Application of Grey Systems Theory in the Analysis of Data Obtained from Family Businesses 496 consistent with the results of correlation studies for a large amount of data describing this phenomenon (Delcea, 2015a; 2015b; Liu at al., 2011, Liu and Zhu, 1996; Liu and Wang, 1996; Scarlat and Delcea, 2011; Wu and Chen, 2011; Yuan, Guo, and Liu, 2013; Yi, 1987; Xu and Gao, 2007; Huang, Baetz, and Patry, 1993). The current state of research on the reduction of the need to use large samples in the field of family entrepreneurship with the use of GST tools should be described as the initial one. The intention of the authors of the article is to present that for a specific problem, which is the causes of conflicts in family enterprises, the use of GST tools allows conducting research on small samples because the results obtained are convergent for both large and small samples. At the current state of research, generalization of conclusions regarding the size of samples to address any problems of family entrepreneurship with the use of GST tools is premature. The authors, however, believe that such a situation is natural at the current stage of research development and generalizations will be able to be carried out after conducting a series of analyses on the diverse issues of family entrepreneurship. The large accumulation of individual cases will allow to draw a conclusion that the problem of the necessity of using large samples in quantitative research on family entrepreneurship has been eliminated using GST methods. 2. Grey Systems Theory Grey Systems Theory was proposed in 1982 by Chinese mathematician Deng (1989) as another methodology of data analysis, next to already existing statistical methods, Fuzzy Logic and Rough Set Theory. GST had long remained widely unknown because the first publications on the subject were released in English in 1989, whereas its full comprehensive description in the form of a book was published as late as in 2006 (Liu and Lin, 2006; Liu and Lin, 2011). Currently, this theory is being dynamically developed, which is confirmed by an increase in publications related to its application in economic, social, and technical sciences (Yi, 1987; Xu and Gao, 2007; Scarlat and Delcea, 2011; Wu and Chen, 2011; Liu and Lin, 2010; Yuan, Guo, and Liu, 2013; Delcea, 2015b; Więcek-Janka, Mierzwiak, and Kijewska 2016a; Więcek-Janka and Mierzwiak, 2017). Theoretical and practical research in Grey Systems Theory focuses on a few principal aspects. They can relate to diverse branches of science and economic practice. Traditional grey systems methods can be divided into (Liu at al., 2016): • Grey Incidence Analysis like regression models, • Grey Forecast Models based on specific differential equations, • Grey Clustering Models aimed at grouping the objects, • Grey Decision Models similar to multi-criteria decision-making methods, • Hybrid Models which combine Grey Systems Theory methods with data analysis methods such as Rough Set Theory or Fuzzy Logic. Ewa Więcek-Janka, Rafał Mierzwiak, Marcin Nowak, Agnieszka Kujawińska, Joanna Majchrzak 497 All the above-mentioned methods of Grey Systems Theory may be used in the context of family business research. This appears particularly useful when the set of collected empirical data is small or if there are problems with determining distributions of the analyzed random variables. It is a typical area in which GST can be applied. GST then can be treated as a complementary set of methods and tools with respect to classical statistical analysis. When the application of GST methods in family business research is analyzed, one can arrive at the conclusion that their use in that respect has so far been marginal. The only applications related to family business research which can be found in source literature are: Grey Incidence Analysis (GIA) (Więcek-Janka, Mierzwiak, and Kijewska 2016a; Mierzwiak and Więcek-Janka 2016) and GCA (Więcek-Janka, Mierzwiak, and Kijewska, 2016b). It does not, however, exclude the possibility of using other grey methods in family business research, which is confirmed by their extensive application in economics- and management-related aspects (Delcea, 2015b). Grey Systems Theory methods are meant to be used in cases when a researcher has access to a limited amount of data, when mechanisms governing relationships in the analyzed systems are only partially known and in particular (Liu and Lin, 2010): − the information of elements (or parameters) is incomplete, − the information on structure is incomplete, − the information on boundary is incomplete, − the behavior information of movement is incomplete. Grey Systems Theory may be a useful tool with due to its specific character and in many cases may enrich the apparatus set used in data analysis methods. The application of this theory in analyses related to family businesses is worth considering as access to information is difficult, population to be studied is large and there is reluctance to share experiences connected not only with business aspects but, first and foremost, with family aspects (Więcek-Janka and Mierzwiak, 2015; Więcek- Janka, Mierzwiak, and Kijewska, 2016a; Więcek-Janka, Mierzwiak, and Kijewska, 2016b). The place Grey Systems Theory occupies in the structure of existing information analysis solutions is shown in Table 1. Table 1.

It is a consequence of operating on a small sample in which one allows for the emergence of insufficient and incomplete data (Table 1). In Grey Systems Theory, the equivalent of the variable dependency analysis is Grey Incidence Analysis (GIA). Thanks to GIA, one can analyze a relationship between variables describing the studied phenomenon (problem). The theoretical basis of analyzing these dependencies is the study of geometric similarity of data vectors represented in Euclidean space. By means of GIA, one can assess similarity between two vectors and their degree of association if we know that one of them represents an independent variable and the other one represents a dependent variable (Liu and Lin, 2006; Liu and Lin, 2010; Liu, Yang, and Forrest, 2016). 3. Data Collection To verify the set hypothesis (see: Introduction), data concerning the influence of conflicts upon family and business spheres in family businesses in Poland was collected. A general population unit, following the European Union definition of 2009, was taken to be a firm which meets one of the following four criteria (https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/pro-moting-entrepreneurship/we-work-for/family- business_en): [1] Most decision-making rights are in the possession of the natural person(s) who established the firm, or in the possession of the natural person(s) who has/have acquired the share capital of the firm, or in the possession of their spouses, parents, child, or children’s direct heirs. [2] Most decision-making rights are indirect or direct. [3] At least one representative of the family or kin is formally involved in the governance of the firm. https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/pro-moting-entrepreneurship/we-work-for/family-business_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/pro-moting-entrepreneurship/we-work-for/family-business_en Ewa Więcek-Janka, Rafał Mierzwiak, Marcin Nowak, Agnieszka Kujawińska, Joanna Majchrzak 499 [4] Listed companies meet the definition of family enterprise if the person who established or acquired the firm (share capital) or their families or descendants possess 25 per cent of the decision-making rights mandated by their share capital. For such a numerous general population, the minimum size of the sample in questionnaire-based research which allowed to generalize the analyses numbered 383 family businesses6. The size of the sample obtained in the study was larger than the assumed one and numbered 422 businesses. The research made use of a survey method using CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interview). Due to errors and incomplete answers, two questionnaires were excluded from the obtained set. The evaluation of the variables was performed on a scale ordering the frequency of their occurrence. The statements were adopted as parameters: “it never happens to me”, “it happens rarely”, “it happens sometimes”, “it happens often”, “it always happens”, and “I have no opinion”. The research questionnaire contained, among others, two questions related to the selection of the direction of profit allocation of family businesses, which related to the adopted dependent variables: Y1 – level of conflicts concerning family-related issues, Y2 – level of conflicts concerning business issues. Moreover, the questionnaire contained 10 questions determining independent variables which allowed to perform a multi-faceted characterization of a studied firm. They were: X1 – generation exercising authority, X2 – number of family members employed in a business, X3 – total number of employees, X4 – age of a business, X5 – bringing successors up in the entrepreneurial spirit, X6 – controlling business operation outside set working hours, X7 – level of family members’ engagement in the business sphere, X8 – level of employed family members’ privileges, X9 – perspective of investment planning, X10 – degree of business innovation. The structure of the analyzed sample is presented in Table 2. 6Minimum sample numbered 383 businesses, with α= 0.05, b=0.05 and p=0.5.

Research Methodology To compare the results of research conducted using traditional statistical methods and the results which can be obtained using Grey Systems Theory methods, a proceedings methodology has been developed. The fundamental principle of this methodology is to conduct a statistical analysis on a large sample (420 units), and then to check whether similar results may be obtained using small samples (30 units) randomly selected from the large sample and analyzed by means of Grey Systems Theory instruments. Regarding the specific character of data, correlational procedures were used in the statistical analysis, whereas with regard to the grey analysis, the procedure of Grey Incidence Analysis was used (Liu and Lin, 2006; Liu and Lin, 2011). Figure 1 presents a detailed way of proceedings. Ewa Więcek-Janka, Rafał Mierzwiak, Marcin Nowak, Agnieszka Kujawińska, Joanna Majchrzak 501 Figure 1. Adopted research methodology (own elaboration) According to Figure 1, the developed methodology consists of the following eight steps: [1] COLLECTING EMPIRICAL DATA: Collecting empirical data related to dependent variables and independent variables ( . A detailed description of this process can be found in the Data collection section. [2] VERIFYING EMPIRICAL DATA: Checking the comprehensiveness and correctness of data coding. [3] STRUCTURE OF CONTINGENCY TABLES: Development of contingency tables which allowed to tabulate the distribution of answers for two variables: independent (rows) and dependent variable (columns). Contingency tables allow to receive answers to two questions: are the differences in the distributions in the table statistically significant and what is the strength of association between variables?

They were expressed by means of the following coefficients: ‒ C-Pearson’s contingency: C = √ 𝛘2 n+χ2 ; where n-sample size and 2 is chi-squared statistic. With the lack of dependency, coefficient C is 0, whereas the top boundary depends on the number of categories of variables. For table n x n, this boundary equals: √ w-1 w ; where w-number of rows in the table. ‒ Cramer’s V, which takes values from the interval <0; 1>: ‒ V = √ 𝛘2 n(k-1) ; k-smaller from the number of columns or rows. [4] SETTING THE ORDER: Based on the indicators of the strength of association between variables, the order of the influence of particular variables on variables was determined. As a result of these operations, two orders of variables were set. The first one in relation to variable , the second one in relation to . The foundation for setting these orders is Cramer’s V coefficient. [5] SAMPLING: 10 samples (30-unit) were randomly selected from the entire set of empirical data (N=420). Random sampling with replacement was performed. [6] GREY INCIDENCE ANALYSIS: The grey relational indicator between and for each of 10 samples was calculated. To this end, the following operations were performed: ‒ variable Xi = (xi(1), xi(2), …, xi(n)) was developed by means of operator D1 in the following way: XiD1 = (xi(1)d1, xi(2)d1, …, xi(n)d1) where: xi(k)d1 = xi(k) - min {xi(k) / max {xi(k)} - min {xi(k)} for k=1,2, …, n. ‒ variable Yi = (yi(1), yi(2), …, yi(n)) was developed by means of interval operator D1 in the following way: i X j Y i X j Y iX 1 Y 2 Y i X j Y Ewa Więcek-Janka, Rafał Mierzwiak, Marcin Nowak, Agnieszka Kujawińska, Joanna Majchrzak 503 ‒ YiD1 = (yi(1)d1, yi(2)d1, …, yi(n)d1) where: yi(k)d1 = yi(k) - min {yi(k) / max {yi(k)} - min {yi(k)} for k=1,2, …, n. Following the development of data by means of operator D1, the symbols of the variables remain unchanged. ‒ A sequence of data necessary for calculations for each 30-unit sample was formed in the following way: ‒ Y1 = (y1(1), y1(2), …, y1(30)) Y2 = (y1(1), y1(2), …, y1(30)) X1 = (x1(1), x1(2), …, x1(30)) X2 = (x2(1), x2(2), …, x2(30)) X3 = (x3(1), x3(2), …, x3(30)) X4 = (x4(1), x4(2), …, x4(30)) X5 = (x5(1), x5(2), …, x5(30)) X6 = (x6(1), x6(2), …, x6(30)) X7 = (x7(1), x7(2), …, x7(30)) X8 = (x8(1), x8(2), …, x8(30)) X9 = (x9(1), x9(2), …, x9(30)) X10 = (x10(1), x10(2), …, x10(30)) ‒ compute the absolute degree of grey incidence. ‒ [7] SETTING THE ORDER: Based on the average of the indicator the absolute degree of grey incidence for 10 samples, the order of the influence of variables  − = += 1 1 )( 2 1 )( n k iiyi nykys  − = += 1 1 )( 2 1 )( n k iixi nxkxs  − = − −+−= 1 1 11 )()( 2 1 )()( n k iiyixi nynxkykxs 11 1 1 1 yxixiy xiy yixi ssss ss −++++ ++ = i X Application of Grey Systems Theory in the Analysis of Data Obtained from Family Businesses 504 on variables was determined. As a result of this operation, two orders were set. The first one in relation to variable , the second one in relation to variable . [8] COMPARING ORDERS: The orders of the influence of variables on variables obtained using statistical procedures were compared with the orders obtained using grey methods. To this end, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. 5. Results of Orders Analysis The analysis of data using the classical approach by means of contingency tables for a large sample of 420 allowed to assess the significance of the influence of independent variables X1-X10 as well as their strength of influence on dependent variables Y1, Y2.

A significant influence of analyzed variables on a dependent variable was proven: Y1: X1, X2, X5, X6, X7, X8. In case of Y2 variable, the influence of variables: X1, X2, X7, X8, X9, X10 was proven. j Y 1 Y 2 Y i X j Y Ewa Więcek-Janka, Rafał Mierzwiak, Marcin Nowak, Agnieszka Kujawińska, Joanna Majchrzak 505 From the point of view of succession changes which in recent years have been intensely taking place in Poland, it seems of particular importance to analyze the influence of the generation that is exercising control on the emergence of family- related conflicts. As it was shown in the research, it is the authority-exercising generation (X1) that is associated with the analyzed conflict spheres. The detailed analysis of the contingency tables allows to state that the first generation of family business owners in Poland largely gets into conflicts with family (Y1), less often in the business sphere (Y2). However, both in the former and latter case, the influence of this variable on Y1 and Y2 is statistically significant with a medium force of association. Similar “behaviour” is observed in case of X2 variable (number of family members employed in a firm) and X8 (level of family employees’ privileges), which affects dependent variables in a similar way. It means that the number of family members engaged in business activity (X2) influences both family and business conflicts. Similar influence is exerted by the level of family employees’ privileges (X8) on Y1. The analysis of Cramer’s V indicator points to a medium force of association of X2 (number of family members) on the analyzed level of family-related conflicts and low for business conflicts. Similar results are observed for X8 variable (level of family employees’ privileges) (cf. table 3). Slightly higher results of Cramer’s V test were obtained for X7 variable (level of family members’ engagement in the business sphere). In this case it is 0.61 for Y1 variable and 0.48 for Y2 variable. The analysis of the contingency tables shows that the higher level of family members’ engagement in the business sphere is, the greater family-related conflicts (Y1) are. Such an interdependency was not noted in case of analyzing contingency tables for X7 (level of family members’ engagement in the business sphere) with Y2 (level of conflicts concerning business issues). The results of analyzing the significance of the influence of X9 variable (perspective of investment planning) on Y1 did not confirm this influence, unlike in case of Y2 variable. Association between X9 and Y2 was proven, and the force of this association may be regarded as extremely high (the result of Cramer’s V coefficient at the level of 0.94). The obtained result relates to the specific character of family businesses’ functioning in Poland, which is based on family values more often connected with tradition than innovation. Such businesses base their structure and mission on tradition whereas the environment puts pressure on using innovative solutions both in production, service-related and trade-related processes, and company organization. In such a situation, when it becomes necessary to satisfy opposed expectations, one observes the emergence of conflicts in company structure, which relate to making decisions, allocating financial resources, being responsible for planned activities, etc. X10 variable (the degree of business innovation) significantly influences Y2. The force of association between these variables is at a medium level (Cramer’s V – 0.47). The analysis of the contingency tables points to lowering the assessment of conflict Application of Grey Systems Theory in the Analysis of Data Obtained from Family Businesses 506 intensification in the business spheres with the high assessment of business innovation. Summarizing the qualitative character of the obtained data, one can state that the greatest influence on family-related conflicts in family businesses is exercised by bringing up future successors in the entrepreneurial spirit and the level of family members’ engagement in the business sphere. The greatest influence on business conflicts is exercised by the perspective of investment planning and the level of family employees’ privileges. Next, based on the force of association, the order of variables was determined using a chi-square test. The first place was taken up by a variable for which the force expressed by means of Cramer’s V coefficient was the greatest (table 5 – “chi-square test” column). Grey Incidence Analysis was used to determine the force of association between independent and dependent variables, for small samples (30-element, step 7 in the methodology). The analysis results are presented in Table 4. Table 4.

The results obtained from the chi-squared test and GIA were treated as pairs. It was assumed in the null hypothesis that there are no statistically significant differences between the set orders. The adopted significance level in the carried-out test (separate for variables Y1 and Y2) was equal to 0.05. Table 6. Results of the Wilcoxon test for variables Y1 and Y2 Test statistic p-value Decision H0: Lack of differences between the order of variables X1-X10 for variable Y1 set when using the classical approach and the order set in GIA 17 0.955 no reason to reject the hypothesis 0 H0: Lack of differences between the order of variables X1-X10 for variable Y2 set when using the classical approach and the order set in GIA 22.5 0.999 no reason to reject the hypothesis 0 The results of the test presented in table 6 show that the order of dependent variables obtained in the classical approach may be the same as in the case of using Grey Incidence Analysis. 6. Summary The conducted research allowed to collate the results of the analyses carried out using classical statistical methods for a large sample with the analysis performed using the GIA method for small samples. The obtained research results confirm the hypothesis which says that the results of conclusions drawn from a small amount of data using the GST methods are in keeping with the results of correlational research for a large Application of Grey Systems Theory in the Analysis of Data Obtained from Family Businesses 508 amount of data defining the same phenomenon. The positive verification of the presented research hypothesis underlies a valid conclusion for researchers engaged in the issues related to family businesses, which states that when there are problems with collecting a large sample or when we want to conduct a quick pilot or preliminary study which will examine interdependencies between variables defining a given phenomenon, a new and alternative statistical research methodology to be used may be Grey Systems Theory.
