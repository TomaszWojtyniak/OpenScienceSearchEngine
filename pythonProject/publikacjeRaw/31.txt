Copy number variations (CNVs) greatly contribute to intraspecies genetic polymorphism and phenotypic diversity. Recent analyses of sequencing data for >1000 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions focused on small variations and did not include CNVs. Here, we performed genome-wide analysis and identified large indels (50 to 499 bp) and CNVs (500 bp and larger) in these accessions. The CNVs fully overlap with 18.3% of protein-coding genes, with enrichment for evolutionarily young genes and genes involved in stress and defense. By combining analysis of both genes and transposable elements (TEs) affected by CNVs, we revealed that the variation statuses of genes and TEs are tightly linked and jointly contribute to the unequal distribution of these elements in the genome. We also determined the gene copy numbers in a set of 1060 accessions and experimentally validated the accuracy of our predictions by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assays. We then successfully used the CNVs as markers to analyze population structure and migration patterns. Finally, we examined the impact of gene dosage variation triggered by a CNV spanning the SEC10 gene on SEC10 expression at both the transcript and protein levels. The catalog of CNVs, CNV-overlapping genes, and their genotypes in a top model dicot will stimulate the exploration of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. INTRODUCTION The frequent occurrence of duplications and deletions in eukaryotic genomes is among the most crucial factors that affect adap- tation, evolution, and speciation (Kondrashov, 2012; Panchy et al., 2016). There are numerous lines of evidence that at an in- traspecies level, these DNA copy number changes contribute to the phenotypic variation of humans, animals, and plants (McHale et al., 2012; Handsaker et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016). Accordingly, efforts toward developing tools to detect copy number variations (CNVs) and map polymorphic regions have recently intensified. A good example of this trend is the latest advance in CNV discovery in the human genome, which has been empowered by the con- secutive release of data from three phases of the 1000 Genomes Project. Remarkably, 60% of CNVs identified in phase 3 of this project (Sudmant et al., 2015) were novel compared to those identified in previous reports by Mills et al. (2011) and the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al. (2012), reflecting the meth- odological improvements and the importance of using large, di- versified data sets. The number of plant species for which CNV regions have been identified at the genome-wide scale has grown rapidly within the last decade (Swanson-Wagner et al., 2010; Chia et al., 2012; Muñoz-Amatriaín et al., 2013;Duitamaet al., 2015;Hardiganet al., 2016; Fuentes et al., 2019). However, for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), an important model plant (Alonso-Blanco and Koornneef, 2000) with more than 1000 accessions whose genomes have been sequenced with coverage between 53 and 1183 (1001 GenomesConsortium et al., 2016), comprehensive genome-wide CNV analysis is still required. Previous CNV analyses in Arabi- dopsis have been limited to individual lines or small populations and most often focused on characterizing presence-absence variation only. One of the earliest studies of this type combined the results of array-based hybridization and short read–based whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify $100-bp deletions in thegenomesof four Arabidopsis accessions: Eil-0, Lc-0, Sav-0, and Tsu-1 (Santuari et al., 2010). These deletions overlapped with 987 to 1344 protein-coding genes (for simplicity, we refer to them as genes hereafter), andmany of themwere shared by at least two accessions. A larger study that focused on comparing the ge- nomes of 17 accessions that were sequenced and assembled de 1Address correspondence to akisiel@ibch.poznan.pl or marekf@ibch. poznan.pl.

Based on the same WGS data, Bush et al. (2014) identified nu- merous exon-overlapping regions in theArabidopsis genome that were absent from at least one accession. These regions over- lappedwith 411 genes. Awider study that, in addition to detecting large deletions, also identified duplications and multiallelic CNVs included WGS data from 80 accessions from Europe, Asia, and North Africa (Cao et al., 2011). The identified CNVs covered 1.8% of the reference genome and overlapped with nearly 500 genes. Subsequent copynumber genotypingof several genesperformed by our group using these 80 accessions indicated, however, that the number of genes affected byCNVsmay in fact bemuchhigher (Samelak-Czajka et al., 2017). Another study involved the de- tection of regions of deletions and duplications among 180 ac- cessions, but these accessions represented a narrow local population from Sweden (Long et al., 2013). In these accessions, more than7700 regionswithduplicationsof afixedsize (3 kb)were identified. A read depth–based approach for CNV detection was used by both Cao et al. (2011) and Long et al. (2013), without further refinement of the CNV breakpoints. Recently, WGS data from a global collection of 1135 Arabi- dopsis accessions were released by the 1001 Genomes Con- sortium et al. (2016), and a catalog of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as insertions and deletions shorter than 50 bp (short indels) was created based on these data. Here, we extended the spectrum of characterized genetic varia- tions in these accessions by calling and analyzing large indels and CNVs. We determined the distribution and genomic content of CNV regions and performed population-scale copy number analysis of genes overlapping with CNVs. We investigated the variation in and relative distributions of genes and transposable elements (TEs). We then successfully used gene copy number estimates as markers to reconstruct the genetic structure of the Arabidopsis population. We also demonstrated that natural changes in gene dosage may lead to variations in transcript and protein levels. The CNV map and copy number genotyping data generated in this studyprovideabackground for further studieson the genetic bases of phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis. RESULTS Identification of CNVs and Large Indels We selected 1064 high-quality WGS data sets from the 1135 data sets available in the 1001 Genomes Project collection and per- formed an integratedCNV analysis (Figure 1A). To this end, we set up a pipeline that combined the three main types of read sig- natures that can be used forCNV identification (Alkan et al., 2011). We used three read depth–based tools, namely, CNVnator (Abyzov et al., 2011), Control-FREEC (Boeva et al., 2011), and the Genome STRiP-CNV module (Handsaker et al., 2015); two dis- cordant read pair–based tools, namely, BreakDancer (Chen et al., 2009) and VariationHunter (Hormozdiari et al., 2009); the split read–based tool Pindel (Ye et al., 2009); and a hybrid approach implemented in the Genome STRiP-SV module (Handsaker et al., 2015). Methods relying on read depth signatures are the most sensitive indetecting largesize variations (Figure1B) andaremore successful when analyzing regions with segmental duplications (Yoon et al., 2009; Teo et al., 2012). However, their accuracy in estimatingCNVbreakpoints is low (Figure 1C) anddependson the window size used during the calling step. Tools based on dis- cordant read pair mappings are more precise in setting CNV breakpoints but are unable to detect large variants (Supplemental 1798 The Plant Cell D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /plcell/article/32/6/1797/6115649 by guest on 08 A ugust 2021 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 Figure 1) or to identify highly duplicated regions. Pindel, which is based on split reads, reports variants at a single-nucleotide resolution but is more sensitive to short indels than to CNVs; additionally, it generates a very large number of predictions with a high false-positive rate (Li et al., 2013). To handle these con- straints, we separately processed CNVs (defined here as un- balanced variations at least 0.5 kb in length) and large indels (variants 50 to 499 bp in length). For CNVs, we selected variants that were detected by at least one readdepth–basedorhybridapproach (Supplemental Tables1 and 2). In the next step, whenever possible, we further refined the CNVborderswith theadditional support of the remainingcallers to improve the accuracy of CNV breakpoint predictions. Finally, we included only variants supported by at least two of the seven callers that were used in the list of high-confidence regions that are copy number variable in the Arabidopsis genome, hereafter Figure 1.

Thisdatasetconsistsof19,003 CNVs that vary in length from 500 to 984,676 bp, 92.1% of which are shorter than 20 kb. These variants are listed in Supplemental Data Set 1, along with 15,365 low-confidence CNVs, which were supported by only one caller and were not further investigated. We identified large indels by combining 50- to 499-bp-long variants from the read pair–based callers only, followed by re- dundancy removal, and set boundaries with the support from hybrid- and split read–based callers. As a result, we obtained 70,137 variants (Supplemental Data Set 2). Of these, 4149 ex- ceeded the upper size limit defined in our pipeline as a result of merging andbreakpoint refinement.Wedid not remove them from the final large indel data set since they were identified using a different approach fromAthCNVs. Overall, large indels had 56% overlap with AthCNVs. We then compared the genomic distribution of the newly identified variantswith that of the previously identified short indels (1001 Genomes Consortium et al., 2016). All types of variants (short indels, large indels, and AthCNVs) were most abundant in the pericentromeric regions and less abundant in the chromo- somearms (Figure2).However, short indelshadmoderateoverlap with AthCNVs (46%) and very little overlap with large indels (8%). Thus, our results substantially complement the existing catalog of known structural variations present in the Arabidopsis genome. In thesubsequentanalysis,we focusedonCNVssince thisclass of variants—due to their size—may directly influence the copy number and dosages of entire functional loci, including genes. Since our data analysis pipeline involved two CNVmerging steps (between samples and between tools) that preceded the break- point refinement step, we attempted to verify the sensitivity and accuracy of our approach at three levels: species, geo- graphically related accessions, and individual genomes (Figure 3A and 3B). For species-level verification, we used CNVspreviously identified in a population of 80 accessions that represented a similar geographic range and were not included in our data set (Cao et al., 2011). Of the 1059 CNVs identified in that study, 87% overlapped with AthCNV regions and 81% were positioned entirely within them. This result was in line with our expectations, since the previously identified CNVs were much shorter. For verificationat the level ofgeographically relatedaccessions, we evaluated the overlap of the AthCNV data set with the dupli- cations and deletions previously detected in 180 Swedish accessions (Long et al., 2013), 174 of which were also included in our analysis. After merging directly adjacent regions with dupli- cationsand removingprivate variants (since theywerealsofiltered outbyourCNVdiscoverypipeline; seeMethods),weobtained235 deletions and 1487 duplications$0.5 kb in length in the Swedish samples. We observed that 76% of deletion regions overlapped with the AthCNVs, and 51%were positioned entirely within them. Likewise, 68% of duplication regions overlapped with AthCNVs, and 50% were located entirely within them. Finally, we investigated how well the AthCNV data set fit the variants identified in eight genomes representing individual accessions. One genome (KBS-Mac-74 accession) has been assembled to the contig level from Nanopore ultralong reads (Michael et al., 2018). We used the Assemblytics tool (Nattestad and Schatz, 2016) to identify CNVs in this genome (Supplemental Data Set 3). The seven remaining genomes (An-1, C24, Cvi-0, Eri- 1, Kyoto, Ler, and Sha accessions) were assembled into five chromosome-level scaffolds from PacBio ultralong reads, and structural variants were identified with the SyRI tool (Jiao and Schneeberger, 2020). Note that both SyRI and Assemblytics rely on the same genome aligner, MUMmer. We selected CNVs$0.5 kb in length (the reference genome coordinates were considered in the size evaluation) and compared them with our data set. In each accession, the majority of CNVs (91 to 99%) were shorter than 20 kb, similar to the AthCNVs. From 88 to 94%of the CNVs in each accession overlapped with the AthCNVs by at least 1 bp. As many as 63 to 77% deletions, but only 22 to 25% duplications overlapped with individual AthCNVs by at least 70% and therefore had similar lengths and breakpoint locations (Supplemental Figure 2). We also observed that the AthCNVs for which the breakpoints best fit the breakpoints of variants found in individual genomes, that is, the localization of one of their borders (left or right) differed by no more than 610 bp (Figure 3C), were mostly refined using the split reads and hybrid approach (91 to 94%) or the discordant read pair approach (7 to 9%). These observations validate the approach we used to assess CNV borders (the highest priority was given to the information provided by the callers based on discordant read pairs and split reads) and explained the lower accuracy of assessing duplication break- points. Taking the above-mentioned information into account, the AthCNV map reliably represents variants present in individual accessions. Figure 2.

Four addi- tional genesoverlappedwith low-confidencevariants,whichwere also detected by our CNV discovery pipeline. Thus, our data are highly consistent with the existing experimental evidence on the distribution of CNVs in the Arabidopsis genome. Genomic Content in CNV Regions We observed uneven genome coverage by CNVs (Table 1). From 84 to 99%of the centromeric regionswere covered byCNVs, with multiple CNVs of various lengths overlapping with each other (Supplemental Figure 4). In Arabidopsis, the centromeres are rich in 178- to 180-bp repeats and TEs (Minoru, 2013). Additionally, in the noncentromeric parts of the genome, the distribution of CNVs was positively correlated with the distribution of TEs and nega- tively correlated with the distribution of the genes. Nevertheless, a very large number of genes (7712) overlappedwithCNV regions. We hereafter refer to genes and TEs covered by AthCNVs by at least 1 bp as CNV-genes and CNV-TEs, respectively, to distin- guish them from NONVAR-genes and NONVAR-TEs, which did not overlap with any CNVs.We then investigatedmore deeply the fraction of CNV-genes that were covered by CNVs for $90% of their length (Figure 4A). These genes were highly represented by orphangenes, that is,geneswithnodetectablehomologues inany other species (497 of the 1170 orphan genes present in the Arabidopsisgenome)andspecies-specificgene families (49of the 55 families found only in this species; Figure 4B; Supplemental Table 3). They were also significantly overrepresented in genes encoding proteins of an unclassified type (binomial test with Bonferroni-corrected P-value < 0.01; Figure 4C). Similarly, we Figure 3.

In addition, terms related to plant interactions with other organisms, defense, and stress responses were overrepresented in each category. There were no significantly depleted GO terms, but genes en- coding nucleic acid binding proteins, transporters, transferases, and protein kinases were significantly underrepresented in the CNV-genes data set. A recent comparative study of seven Arabidopsis genomes assembleddenovo from long reads revealedmultiple regionswith strongly decreased collinearity and multiple haplotypes (Jiao and Schneeberger, 2020). These regions were referred to as hotspots of rearrangements and were enriched in TEs and depleted in genes, similar to the CNVs identified in our study. Additionally, similar to our CNV-genes, the genes within the hotspots of re- arrangements were enriched for functions related to biotic stress response. In addition, they displayed high CNV and highmutation frequency among the seven accessions. We therefore expected them to be identified as population-level CNVs in our study. In- deed,we found that98.6%of rearrangementhotspotsoverlapped with AthCNVs (73.6% were entirely within CNV regions). Of the eight regions without overlap, two were near AthCNVs (less than 250 bp), and four formed a large cluster with numerous adjacent hotspots of rearrangements, which extended for over 212 kb and was flanked by multiple CNVs on both sides. Many hotspots of rearrangements shared a common pattern of almost exclusively forward tandem gene duplications and large indels (Jiao and Schneeberger, 2020), which prompted us to investigate whether AthCNVswere alsoenriched in tandemduplications. According to thePlaza 4.0 database (VanBel et al., 2018), 25.3%of genes in the Arabidopsis genome are located in regions of segmental dupli- cations, while 12.8% arose through tandem duplication events (additionally, 8.3%are located in regionswith both segmental and tandem duplications). These proportions were reversed among CNV-genes, with 12.4% of these genes localized in regions of segmental duplications and 24.1% in regions of tandem dupli- cations (additionally, 10.7% underwent both segmental and tandem duplications; Figure 4D). Altogether, these observations indicate that the regions of tandem duplications are sites that accumulate rearrangements and, consequently, show high structural diversity. In the next step, we analyzed CNV-TEs, which constituted 67.5% of all TEs. These TEs were slightly depleted in RC/Helitron TEs and enriched in long terminal repeat/Gypsy TEs (Figure 4E); however, the composition of CNV-TE superfamilies did not changemuchcompared toall TEs (Supplemental Table4).Wealso investigated howmany CNV-TEs were proximal to genes, that is, overlapped with genes or were located within 2-kb regions flanking the genes. Only 36.2% of CNV-TEs were proximal to genes, and they were slightly enriched in RC/Helitron TEs but severely depleted in long terminal repeat/Gypsy TEs compared to both all CNV-TEs and the entire genome. They were also mod- erately enriched in DNA/MuDR elements. In contrast to CNV-TEs, genes with TEs in their proximity constituted the majority (64.4%) of the CNV-gene data set. Interplay between the Copy Number Polymorphism of Genes and TEs To investigate the relationship between the copy number poly- morphism of genes and TEs, we compared the genomic dis- tributions of CNV-genes and CNV-TEs. Both CNV-genes and CNV-TEs were, on average, located closer to the chromosome centromeres than were their NONVAR counterparts, and this tendency was much stronger for TEs than for genes (Figure 5A). However, the average distance between CNV-genes and the nearest TEs was smaller than the average distance between NONVAR-genes and the nearest TEs. The reverse was observed for CNV-TEs, which were, on average, farther from the nearest gene than were NONVAR-TEs (Supplemental Figure 5). Our ob- servations indicated that some selective forces have opposite effects on shaping the relative distribution patterns of CNV-genes and CNV-TEs. The cut-insert and copy-insert mechanisms un- derlying TE mobility may affect adjacent genes, usually in a neg- ative manner, for example, by interrupting gene coding or regulatory sequences, by gene rearrangement and duplication, or by altering their DNA methylation status (Quadrana et al., 2016; Bourqueetal., 2018).Geneproximitymay thereforebeconsidered anegative forceactingagainst nearbyTE transposition, especially Table 1.

On the other hand, TE proximity may contribute to increased copy number polymorphism of nearby genes by inducing DNA breaks and genomic instability. To extend our observations to all genes, we analyzed the dis- tances and compared the CNV statuses of genes and their proximal TEs.We foundstrongenrichment inpairswhereproximal TEs and genes had the same variation statuses (Figure 5B), Figure 4.

Furthermore, 3911 of 4968 unique CNV- genes (79%)hadonlyCNV-TEs in their proximity and5895of 8033 unique NONVAR-genes (73%) had only proximal NONVAR-TEs (Figure5C).Additionally, thegene-TEpairswith thesamevariation statuses were located closer to each other than pairs with the opposite statuses. Combining the information about the genomic distribution and relative distances of genes and TEs clearly re- vealed that the localization of polymorphic gene–TE pairs was biased toward centromeres, while the localization of invariable gene–TE pairs was biased toward chromosome ends (Wilcoxon rank sum testwith continuity correction for thedifferencebetween CNV-CNV and NONVAR-NONVAR groups, P-value < 0.0001; Figure 5D). Moreover, CNV-genes with proximal CNV-TEs were enriched in extracellular proteins and proteins involved in cell disruption, defense responses, and nucleic acid catabolism (SupplementalDataSet5). At thesame time,NONVAR-geneswith proximal NONVAR-TEs were enriched in nuclear proteins and proteins involved in nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of fer- tilization, and transcription factor activity. Therewas nodifference in the chromosomal distribution of pairs displaying opposite variation statuses, and no or fewGO termswere enriched in these two groups. Interestingly, the combined variation status of gene–TE pairs wasalsoapparently related to thepositionofTEs relative tonearby genes (Figure 5E). All TEs localized in proximity to genes were 1.2 Figure 5. Links between Genes and TE Variation and Localization.

CNV-TEs very rarely overlappedwithNONVAR-genes (3.8%cases)compared toCNV- genes (19.4%) or NONVAR-TEs, which overlapped with both NONVAR-genes and CNV-genes at similar frequencies (20.2 and 17.4%, respectively). The four groups had similar TE family compositions, which indicated that these differences were not caused by insertion bias of any specific TEs. Altogether, our observations confirmed the presence of selective constraints reciprocally imposed on genes and TEs, which is an important factor contributing to their present variation and genomic distri- bution patterns. Copy Number Genotyping and Experimental Evaluation of CNV-Genes After we identified the genomic regions showing copy number polymorphism in Arabidopsis, we used the Genome STRiP SVGenotypermodule (Handsakeret al., 2015) toevaluate thecopy number statuses of CNV-genes in individual accessions based on read depth estimates. Based on our earlier observations, we decided to directly evaluate the copy numbers of the genes covered by AthCNVs (using the gene coordinates as the input) instead of the AthCNVs themselves. Our motivation was to sim- plify the subsequent application of the copy number genotyping data in functional analyses. AthCNVs overlapping with each other may have been formed by different molecular mechanisms and may be present in different accessions (Zmienko et al., 2016); however, at the population scale, they collectively contributed to the copy number diversity of the CNV-genes that they covered (Supplemental Figure 6). Accordingly, we observed that the direct genotypingofCNV-genesprovided themostaccurate information about their copy number statuses in individual accessions. We ultimately genotyped 7324 CNV-genes as well as—for compari- son purposes—5060 genes overlapped by low-confidence CNVs and 14,661 NONVAR-genes in 1060 accessions. These data can be accessed through the web interface at http://athcnv.ibch. poznan.pl in the form of user-generated plots. Genome STRiP SVGenotyper is capable of assigning integer copy numbers to genotyped regions. We found, however, that it frequently assigned the copy number classes to intervals of only one copy; because Arabidopsis is a predominately selfing spe- cies, the expected differences between copy number alleles were multiplesof two (Supplemental Figure7). The integer copynumber assignment by Genome STRiP SVGenotyper was also disturbed by the presence of CNV-genes that did not form clear, discrete copy number classes or for which the reported copy number was very high (up to many thousands of copies) in most accessions, including Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0), which was ex- pected to have the reference diploid copy number (two copies) for each gene. Such problems were commonly encountered when genotyping complex CNVs and CNVs that were mapped to segmental duplications (Conradet al., 2010;Campbell et al., 2011; Handsaker et al., 2015). For these reasons, we reported un- rounded rather than integer copy number outputs. Additionally, we filtered the genotyping data by excluding genes with extreme copynumbers inCol-0separately for eachof the threedatasets. In this step, we removed 451 genes from the analysis. The global distributions of the copy number estimates obtained for CNV-genes significantly differed from those obtained for NONVAR-genes, whichweremore uniform (interquartile range for NONVAR-genes was 0.23 versus 0.30 for CNV-genes) and much more concentrated around the reference diploid copy number value (kurtosis 5 13 for NONVAR-genes versus 120 for CNV- genes). Moreover, CNV-genes had significantly higher copy number variance, larger copy number ranges, and more extreme maximum and minimum copy number values than did NONVAR- genes (Figure 6). Genes covered by low-confidence CNVs had intermediate values, but overall, they were more similar to NONVAR-genes than to CNV-genes. For 1777 (25.3%) CNV-genes, we observed an unexpectedly small level of variation: for these genes, the copy number differ- ence between any two accessions in the population was <2. One reason for the low level of variation in these CNV-genes was their partial overlap with AthCNVs. In these cases, the reads that mapped to the invariable gene segments contributed to read depth estimates, reducing the observed differences between the accessions with distinct copy number statuses (Supplemental Figure 8). Therefore, for all subsequent analyses, we selected only the 5517 CNV-genes that had$50% overlap with AthCNVs. This Figure 6. Differences between CNV-Genes, NONVAR-Genes, andGenes Covered by Low-Confidence CNVs in Terms of the Read Depth–Based Copy Number Genotypes. Thegenotypingdata for7031CNV-genes (red), 4482 low-confidenceCNV- genes (orange), and 14,877NONVAR-genes (blue) were compared for four attributes: thecoefficient of theCNV (CV; top left), thecopynumber range in a population represented by 1060 accessions (top right), and theminimum (min.) and maximum (max.) copy number values (bottom left and bottom right, respectively). For each attribute tested, CNV-genes significantly differed from the other groups (Kruskal–Wallis test, P < 0.0001, Dunn– Bonferroni post hoc method P-value < 0.0001).

To further investigate the possible reasons for their low variation, we assigned each CNV-gene to its longest overlapping AthCNV and found that all CNV-genes with little variation in copy number were contained in only 332 AthCNVs. Moreover, 228 of these AthCNVs also encompassed CNV-genes with high CNV (Supplemental Figure 9). This result suggested that some AthCNVs included small nonvariable subregions, presumably not identified during the segmentation step. We further observed that the presence of this mosaicism was related to AthCNV size— CNV-genes with little variation in copy number were covered by very long AthCNVs, with a median size of 183.4 kb. For com- parison, the median size of AthCNVs covering CNV-genes with high CNV was 19.9 kb. We further verified the accuracy of our read depth–based copy number estimates by performing multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assays using 314 accessions (i.e., 30% of the genomes genotyped with Genome STRiP). The experiment involved CNV-genes located in 45 nonoverlapping AthCNVs (Supplemental Figure 10) and four NONVAR-genes. While read depth–based genotyping provided copy number es- timates for entire CNV-genes, by disregarding factors such as incomplete overlap with AthCNVs, the fine-scaleMLPA approach focused on small (<75-nucleotide) target regions within the as- sayed genes, which made it more precise but also more sensitive to the presence of local sequence variations such as SNPs and indels. After taking these factors into account, we were able to explainmost of the discordant results observed in our experiment by thepresenceofsequencevariation inMLPAprobebindingsites in the assayed accessions (Supplemental Figures 11 and 12). Overall, the MLPA-based genotyping results were in agreement with the read depth–based estimates for all assayed genes (Supplemental Figures 13 to 15). For numerous multiallelic CNV- genes, the clusters of samples with the same copy number could be clearly distinguished by plotting the read depth–based data against the MLPA data (Figure 7). Interestingly, the MLPA analysis provided another, although unexpected, piece of evidence supporting the accuracy of our read depth–based genotyping results. Initially, we included 346 accessions in the MLPA assays. However, 32 of them were re- cently reported as potentially mislabeled in public seed re- positories (from which we acquired our seed collection) based on resequencing and SNP analyses, which failed to assign these stocks to the expected strains (Pisupati et al., 2017). In agreement with these findings, we observed a very strong negative effect of these 32 samples on the correlation between the read depth– based and MLPA results (Supplemental Figure 16; Supplemental Table 5). Consequently, we removed them from the MLPA analysis. Arabidopsis Population Structure Revealed by CNV Markers The analysis of SNP markers in the 1001 Genomes Project accessions revealed that 95% of Arabidopsis accessions belong to one genetic group composed of several subgroups of accessions sharing a similar geographic origin (Platt et al., 2010; 1001 Genomes Consortium et al., 2016). The remaining 5% of accessions (referred to as relicts) form a few groups that are genetically distant from each other and from the nonrelicts (Lee et al., 2017). We aimed to infer Arabidopsis population structure from CNV markers and verify its consistency with the structure derived fromSNPmarkers.We selected 1050AthCNVs of various types (deletions, duplications, and multiallelic CNVs) distributed across the genome and used the copy numbers of the repre- sentative CNV-genes (one gene per AthCNV) as input for principal component analysis (PCA). We then compared our results to population structure derived from 1001 Genomes Project SNP markers. The first two principal components (PCs) revealed that the population is highly structured and that the accession groupings reflect their geographical distribution (Figure 8A),which is consistent with the SNP-based groupings (Cao et al., 2011; Horton et al., 2012). SNPs better distinguished the genetic sub- groups than did the CNVs, which was an expected result, as the subgroups were defined based on SNP variation, and SNPs substantially outnumbered CNV markers (1001 Genomes Con- sortium et al., 2016). However, the CNV-based analysis better reflected theglobal distributionof theaccessions (thedirectionsof the accessions’ separation were consistent with geographical directions, north to south for PC1 and east to west for PC2, after removing clearly unique U.S. accessions; Figure 8B). Interestingly, CNV-based PCA revealed some similarities be- tween the accessions that were not captured by SNP-based grouping. The third and fourth PCs distinguished the groups from the edges of the natural species range and highlighted the genetic similarity of the northern Sweden accessions to the relict genomes from southern Europe (Figure 8C). Remarkably, this observation is in agreement with the recently proposed two-wave expansion model of Arabidopsis across Eurasia, derived from the analysis of the extent of relict introgression in the nonrelict ge- nomes (Lee et al., 2017). According to this model, the populations from different glacial refugia (relicts) expanded from the south of Europe northward at the end of the last ice age. Subsequently, the ancestors of today’s nonrelicts expanded along the east–west axis, probably from the Balkans or the Black Sea area, and re- placed the local accessions, except in the north and south of the species range,where large introgressions from the relict genomes (locally adapted) might have helped the nonrelicts colonize the habitats with more severe climatic conditions. We then compared the extent of CNV-gene copy number changes between 1059 accessions (Col-0was excluded from this analysis). To thisend,we treatedall copynumbergenotypes#1as losses, all copy number genotypes >3 as gains, and all the re- maininggenotypesasunchanged.These thresholdswere justified because the median copy number value for all accessions and all CNV-genes analyzed was 1.98. On average, copy number losses were more frequent in all subgroups (the mean gain-to-loss ratio was 0.5), and their amount differed among the subgroups to agreater extent thandid thatofcopynumbergains (Figure9A).The subgroups least affected by CNVs were Germany (8.2%) and Central Europe (8.6%), while the relicts (11.2%) and northern Sweden (10.0%) subgroupsweremost affected. This orderwas in goodagreementwith thegeneral similarity of the subgroups to the reference genome (the Col-0 accession was assigned to the Germanygroup)butalsoconfirmedthegeneral rule that thechoice ofa referencegenome isacrucial step thatdetermines the rangeof variation that may be identified by a mapping-based approach. 1806 The Plant Cell D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /plcell/article/32/6/1797/6115649 by guest on 08 A ugust 2021 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.19.00640/DC1 In individual accessions, 3.9 to 26.9% of CNV-genes were affected by copy number changes (Figure 9B), and this broad rangewasmostly causedby thedifferences in thenumberof gains (ranging from 88 to 1068) and, to a lesser extent, by the losses (ranging from 114 to 660). The top five accessions in terms of total copynumberchangeswerealso the topfive in termsof thenumber ofgainsandhadagain-to-loss ratio ranging from0.93 to2.77.Two of the accessions were from Sweden (Ull2-5 and Sanna-2), while the remaining accessions were U.S. accessions (KBS-Mac-74, KBS-Mac-68, and BRR57). Gene Dosage, Gene Expression, and Missing Duplications in the Reference Genome: SEC10 Example Duplication of AT5G12370, encoding the SEC10 protein involved in exocytotic vesicle fusion, was recently discovered in the Col- 0 accession (Vuka�sinović et al., 2014).

As a result, we identified eight candidates that were possibly duplicated in Col-0, including SEC10 (Supplemental Figure 17). Our genotyping results in- dicated that the SEC10 duplication was prevalent in the Arabi- dopsis population, as four, six, and eight copies were detected in the diploid genomes of 1039 accessions, 14 accessions, and 1 accession, respectively, while two copies were detected in only 6 accessions (0.56%; Figure 10A). We also evaluated SEC10 ex- pression in 601 accessions using available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data (Kawakatsu et al., 2016) and observed that the transcript levels increased in samples with elevated SEC10 copy numbers (Figure 10B). To determine whether these differences were also reflected at the protein level, we analyzed the SEC10 protein content in 12 accessions representing genotypes with two, four, or six copies of SEC10. Indeed, the mean protein level was significantly higher in accessions with four SEC10 gene copies than in those with two copies (Figure 10C; Supplemental Figure 18). It was also elevated in two of three accessions with six copies compared to samples with no SEC10 duplication. Genome-Wide Association Study of CNVs Several studies have provided evidence that CNVs account for a substantial amount of phenotypic variation. In particular, presence-absence polymorphism of resistance genes that are involved in race-specific recognition of pathogen avirulence de- terminants (McHale et al., 2006) contributes to plant resistance phenotypes. In Arabidopsis, CNVs affect numerous loci related to biotic responses, including RPM1, RPS5, RLM1, RLM3, RPP1, RPP5, and RPP7 (Grant et al., 1998; Henk et al., 1999; Yi and Richards, 2009; Roux and Bergelson, 2016). A previous genome- wide association study revealed strong SNP associations for four hypersensitive response phenotypes to Pseudomonas elicitor proteins: AvrPphB, AvrB, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 (Atwell et al., 2010). Single candidate loci encoding known resistance genes could be associated with these SNPs: RPS5 for AvrPphB, RPM1 for AvrB and AvrRpm1, and RPS2 for AvrRpt2. According to our results,RPS2 is not aCNV-gene; therefore, theassociation for this gene likely resulted from small-scale variation. We wanted to find out, however, whether the remaining two genes, for which the impact of gene deletion on pathogen resistance has been con- firmed previously (Grant et al., 1998; Stahl et al., 1999, Karasov et al., 2014), could be directly distinguished in an association analysis using our genotyping data. To test this possibility, we selected 23 defense-related phenotypes from the Atwell et al. (2010) study, including the four hypersensitive response pheno- types mentioned above (Supplemental Data Set 6). This medium- sized data set consisted of 76 to 175 accessions per phenotype, 51 to 117 of which were shared with our study. Using CNV-gene statuses (gain, loss, or no change) as genetic markers, we filtered the CNV-genes using a 1% minor allele frequency threshold, which left only 2519 CNV-genes. We then evaluated their asso- ciationwith eachphenotypeusinga linearmixedmodel correcting for population structure (efficient mixed-model association Figure 9.

For eight phenotypes, we obtained significant asso- ciationswith one to eight CNV-genes (Supplemental Figure 19). Among these, the strongest were single-gene associations with three phenotypes of interest: avrPphB (RPS5 gene, –log10 P-value5 16.27), avrB (Rpm1 gene, –log10 P-value5 6.81), and avrRpm1 (Rpm1 gene, –log10 P-value5 6.07). These results are in perfect agreement with previous results (Figure 11). This serves as a proof of concept that CNVs can serve as powerful and informative markers for traits where copy number poly- morphism is a causative agent of the observed phenotypic variation. DISCUSSION Analysis using SNP patterns combined with transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenotypic data has led to the efficient discovery of gene function. However, within the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that variation in gene dosage may also lead to phenotypic diversity within a species. Therefore, copy number genotypes must also be considered when attempting to uncover the genetic basis of many traits (Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010; _Zmieńko et al., 2014).

Here, we performed an integrative study involving detailed characterization of CNVs in the Arabidopsis genome and their impact on gene dosages. Our map, based on the WGS data for 1064 accessions, substantially extends the list of identified re- gions with structural variation in this plant obtained from previous studies (Cao et al., 2011; Long et al., 2013). We also performed extensive experimental verification of the genotyping results: we assayed 45 CNV-genes, all in the same set of 314 randomly se- lected accessions, which guaranteed that the results were not biased toward presenting only a subset of data with the strongest correlations for each CNV. We obtained high concordance be- tween the readdepth–based copy numbers and theMLPAsignals not only for deletions but also for rare duplications andmultiallelic CNV-genes, which is worth noting since experimental verification of duplications has been performed occasionally in large-scale CNV discovery studies in plants (Springer et al., 2009; Swanson- Wagner et al., 2010; Saintenac et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2011; McHale et al., 2012;Muñoz-Amatriaín et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013). Similar to studies involvingotherplant species (Chia et al., 2012; Muñoz-Amatriaín et al., 2013; Hardigan et al., 2016), we reported high but uneven genome coverage by CNVs in Arabidopsis. We hypothesize that the distribution of CNVs in the genome results from structural and functional constraints on their formation and preservation. The structural constraints may be reflected by the increased representation of tandem duplicates among the CNV- genes identified in our study,which is consistentwith the previous finding that CNV regions are hotspots of both past and present large-scale variations (Schuster-Böckler et al., 2010; Jiao and Schneeberger, 2020). The functional constraints might cause highly conserved genes and genes encoding proteins involved in numerous interactions within the cell to be underrepresented in CNV regions due to the usually negative effect of changes in their Figure 11.

Copy Number Variations in Arabidopsis Genome 1811 D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /plcell/article/32/6/1797/6115649 by guest on 08 A ugust 2021 dosages (Krylov et al., 2003; Platt et al., 2010). In line with this observation, the CNV-genes detected in our study were enriched for less conserved genes, that is, Arabidopsis-specific genes and genesofunknown function. Thechanges ingenedosagemayalso provide immediate benefits, for example, a rapid increase in the amount of the enzyme providing drug or herbicide resistance. Indeed, there are several examples highlighting the dynamics of CNV-based adaptation (Harms et al., 1992; Jones et al., 1994; Caretto et al., 1995; Gaines et al., 2010; Kondrashov, 2012). Drawing fromnature, processes that induce local changes in DNA copy might therefore be adopted to breed plants with desired traits.However, deeper knowledgeabout themechanismsofCNV formation as well as the function of yet-uncharacterized genes is needed to achieve this goal. AthCNV regions were highly enriched in class I and class II TEs and, similar to the TEs, were unequally distributed across the genome. Indeed, TEs are overrepresented in regions with struc- tural variation (Huanget al., 2008;Caoet al., 2011;Ganetal., 2011; Niu et al., 2019). There is no bias in the localization of newly in- serted TEs; however, the deletion of TEs is an ongoing, active, selective process that is largely responsible for the TE distribution pattern in the Arabidopsis genome (Quadrana et al., 2016). A comparisonof thegenomesof threeArabidopsis accessions,Col- 0, Bur-0, and C24, revealed multiple polymorphic TEs for which large deletions were the most common type of variation (93%; Wang et al., 2013). TEs proximal to genes were less variable than distal TEs, suggesting that nearbygeneshave a negative effect on TE divergence, probably due to stronger selective constraints in these regions. By contrast, TE proximity was positively correlated with the level of small-scalemutations (SNPsand1- to3-bp indels) in the genes, pointing to a link between TEs and gene sequence variation.Ourobservationsare in agreementwithprevious results, and theydemonstrate that the variation statusesof genes andTEs are tightly linked and jointly contribute to the unequal distribution of these elements in the genome. Early studies indicated that the genomes of individual Arabi- dopsis accessions contain segments not present in the reference genome. The total length of the new sequences in these genomes ranges from 1.3 to 3.3 Mbp (Ossowski et al., 2008; Gan et al., 2011). A recent analysis of the de novo assemblies of seven accessions showed that duplications are the most prevalent type of large CNV (Jiao and Schneeberger, 2020). Because of the limitations of short read–based sequencing (Alkan et al., 2011),we did not use de novo assembly-based approaches for CNV dis- covery; therefore, our study focused exclusively on regions that were present in the reference genome. Consequently, we de- tected copy number losses more frequently than copy number gains in most accessions. Nevertheless, by applying population- scale genotyping, we were also able to identify regions missing from the reference genome in our analysis representedby theCol- 0 accession, including the recently described duplication of the SEC10 gene (Vuka�sinović et al., 2014). Homozygousmutant lines with T-DNA insertions in only one SEC10 gene had no obvious mutant phenotype; by contrast, introducing mutations in SEC6 or SEC8,whichalsoencodecomponentsof themultiprotein exocyst complex, led to defects in pollen-specific transmission. SEC10 and its duplicate,which share 99%sequence identity, are thought to be functional and complementary (Vuka�sinović et al., 2014). Here, we showed that the natural duplication of theSEC10gene is correlated with the increased transcription and production of SEC10 protein. Thus, our results strongly support the opinion of Vuka�sinović et al. (2014) on the role of SEC10 duplication in the Arabidopsis Col-0 accession. This example also highlights the importance of carefully considering the genetic background in functional and comparative studies. Therefore,webelieve that the AthCNV map and the patterns of gene CNV resulting from our study will provide a valuable resource to the Arabidopsis com- munity. They may, for example, guide the selection of the most appropriate sets of accessions for downstream analyses when investigating individual regions in the genome, regardless of whether the presence or lack of variation between these ac- cessions is the main point of interest. As we demonstrated for hypersensitive response phenotypes in Arabidopsis, the copy number datamayalsocomplement SNPmarkers in genome-wide association studies (Fuentes et al., 2019), or to some extent supplement the small number of appropriate plant mutants in comparative functional analyses. Because of their repetitive nature and the abundance of TE elements, CNV hotspotsmay accumulate duplications, deletions, and other rearrangements. These rearrangements may be trig- gered by various mechanisms (Gu et al., 2008; Gabur et al., 2019; Krasileva, 2019). Except for nonallelic homologous recombination events, which lead to recurrent copy number changes with nearly identical breakpoints, the CNV breakpoints in a given region may vary among individuals/accessions. The increasing availability and improvement of the accuracy of long-read DNA sequencing may facilitate more detailed characterizations of such com- plex CNVs (Michael et al., 2018; Jiao and Schneeberger, 2020). However, the use of population genetics based on chromosome- level sequence assemblies for large numbers of individuals is still a future goal. We observed high consistency between AthCNVs placedatourmap,which isamapofmergedCNVsand is therefore representative of the entire population rather than individuals, and the variants detected in individual accessions. Thus, we believe that the AthCNV map showing common CNVs in the Arabidopsis genome,combinedwith theCNV-genegenotypingdata,will serve as a useful reference for future studies on variation in Arabidopsis at multiple levels. METHODS Data Preprocessing for CNV Discovery and Analysis The raw reads for 1001 Genomes Project whole-genome shotgun se- quence datawere downloaded from theNational Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive repository (PRJNA273563; https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA273563). Processed RNA-seq data (normalized counts) for 728 accessions were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository (PRJNA319904; https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term5PRJNA319904). The CNV and large indels discovery pipeline was set up based on freely available published tools. Data Filtering and Quality Analysis FastQC v.0.11.5 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/ fastqc) and Trimmomatic v.0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014) were used for read quality analysis and preprocessing. Briefly, the Illumina/Nextera adapter 1812 The Plant Cell D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /plcell/article/32/6/1797/6115649 by guest on 08 A ugust 2021 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA273563 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA273563 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA319904 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA319904 https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc sequenceswere removed, and the leading and trailing sequenceswith low base quality (<15) were trimmed. Reads with <30 bases and an average quality score <20 were removed. Finally, reads with a local drop in base quality (average quality <15 measured with a four-base sliding window) were removed. For 45 accessions, fewer than 50% reads or 5,000,000 reads remained following the quality-based filtering, and these accessions were excluded from further analysis (Supplemental Data Set 7). The se- quencing data for most rejected accessions were generated during the early stageof the 1001GenomesProject (Caoet al., 2011), andwedecided to remove all data generated at that stage (26 additional accessions) due to their overall lower quality and variable read lengths. The final data set for 1064 accessions was further processed with mapping and CNV detection tools following program-specific parameter optimization, as described below. For 23 accessions, we were unable to extract information about read pairs from the downloaded files; therefore, they were analyzed with read depth–based methods only. Read Mapping and Marking Duplicates The genomic reads were mapped to the TAIR10 reference genome as- sembly using BWA-MEM v.07.15 (Li and Durbin, 2010) and mrsFAST v.3.3.0 (Hach et al., 2014) with default parameters. For mrsFASTmapping, all reads within one sample were first trimmed to obtain a uniform length, and the final read length was calculated separately for each sample based on the largest value that allowed at least 80% of the reads to be kept after trimming. Picard Tools v.2.7.1 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and SAMTools v.1.3.1 (Li et al., 2009) were used for data sorting and duplicate removal, respectively. For Genome STRiP analysis, the duplicates were marked, but not removed, to ensure that no unpaired reads remained after theduplicate removal step, sinceGenomeSTRiP requires theavailability of only paired reads in the input data. Calculating the Window Size for Read Depth–Based Methods Thenumber and lengthsof theCNVcallswhen readdepth–basedmethods are used depend on the window/bin size selected for the data-partitioning step.Thebin size is a functionof coverage, read length, anddataquality. To account for all these variables, a bin size evaluation step was performed before the CNV calling step. For CNVnator, the suggested optimal bin size was that forwhich the ratio of theaverage readdepth signal to its SDwas;4 to 5. We calculated statistics for a wide range of bin sizes (100 to 1500 bases, with 100-base increments) for all samples (Supplemental Data Set 8). The selection of a very small bin size (100 bases) to ensure the highest sensitivity and resolutionwas justified formultiple samples, but not for all. Because large discrepancies in the CNV lengths and number between the samples might interfere with the subsequent merging process, we narrowed the acceptable bin size range to 400 to 800 bases. The final bin size was then selected for each sample within this range by determining the smallest value for which the ratio of the average read depth to its SD would be at least 4. For 174 samples, the ratio did not reach the threshold, and they were analyzed with a maximal bin size (800 bases). For Control-FREEC, to evaluate the optimal window size, the coefficient of variation for the read depth data was calculated for a wide range of window sizes, as suggested in a previous report (Boeva et al., 2011). For the final analysis, an overlapping sliding window of 800 bases with a step size of 400 bases was chosen. When this window size was used, the coefficient of variation was below 0.1 for 1025 of 1064 samples (the suggested threshold was 0.05 to 0.1; Supplemental Table 6). We noticed that the optimal window size was similar to the CNVnator bin size parameter, therefore enabling the subsequent comparison and merging of the outputs of the two programs. Calculating the Insert Size Distributions for the Methods Relying on Paired-End Reads BreakDancer, VariationHunter, and Pindel require insert size range thresholds as input parameters. The insert size distribution in each se- quencing library was therefore evaluatedwith Picard Tools. At this step, 44 accessions were removed from analyses with these callers due to the bimodal distributionof the insert sizes (SupplementalFigure20;Chenetal., 2009). The upper and lower threshold cutoffs were then calculated for the remaining libraries using two alternative approaches based on either the mean insert size 6 4 SD or the median insert size 6 5 median absolute deviation, and the maximum result of the two approaches was chosen. CNV and Large Indels Discovery Pipeline Variantswerecalledby three readdepth–basedcallers (CNVnator,Control- FREEC, and Genome STRiP-CNV pipeline), two discordant read pair– based tools (BreakDancer and VariationHunter), a split read–based tool (Pindel), and a combination of the above-mentioned approaches (the Genome STRiP-SV pipeline). CNV calling was performedwith each tool as specifiedbelow.Subsequently, acommonfilter basedonsize (50 to499bp for large indels and at least 0.5 kb for CNVs) and genomic location was applied to the outputs of each caller. Specifically, variants overlappingwith assembly gaps larger than 50 bp (with 50-bp borders) or regions close to the chromosomeends (<1 kb)were discarded. Additional filters specific for each CNV calling algorithm are described below. CNVnator BWA-MEM alignments were used to call duplications and deletions with CNVnator v.0.33 (Abyzov et al., 2011) based on read mapping density, separately for each accession, with nonoverlapping windows. The read depth signals were corrected for GC bias with a script implemented in the tool. The raw duplication and deletion calls were filtered based on variant size and genomic location. Additionally, to select the calls with the highest confidence, we applied a q0 filter (q0 describes the fraction of reads with a mapping quality of 0 in the called CNV; a high q0 indicates mapping uncertainty due to a lack of uniqueness in the region). Calls with a q0$ 0.5 were removed. Finally, the read depth threshold was applied to remove uncertain calls (i.e., deletion calls with a normalized read depth >0.5 and duplication calls with a normalized read depth <1.5). Control-FREEC Aligned BWA-MEMBAM files for each samplewere used to detect regions with gains and losses with Control-FREEC v.9.3 (Boeva et al., 2011) using sliding windows. The average GC content of the Arabidopsis genome varies from 32% in the noncoding regions to 44% in the coding regions; therefore, we set the parameters for GC normalization as follows: minE- xpectedGC 5 0.3 and maxExpectedGC 5 0.45. The telocentromeric parameter was set to 0 because it was included in our common filter. The breakPointThresholdvalue for thesegmentationofnormalizedprofileswas set to 0.6 (default is 0.8) to increase sensitivity and obtain more segments (and thusmore predictedCNVs). The normalized read depth thresholds for CNV detection were #0.25 for loss and $1.75 for gain. BreakDancer The BreakDancerMax program from the BreakDancer package v.1.3.6 (Chen et al., 2009) was used to detect CNVs in each of 997 samples with paired-end data. Calls were made separately for each sample and each chromosome. The raw results that were indicative of CNVs (deletions or insertions) were filtered by amethod-specific filter based on the number of supporting read pairs and the confidence score value. Calls with five or more supporting read pairs and confidence scores >30 were retained.

VariationHunter DIVET files with mrsFAST read alignments were used as the input data (for each sample separately) for VariationHunter v.0.04 (Hormozdiari et al., 2009). The analysis consisted of twomain steps: the first step involved the clustering of discordant paired-end read mappings. This was performed with the default parameter values, which resulted in read pairs with more than 500 alternative mapping positions being discarded (-x 500) and low- quality ambiguous mapping alternatives being removed with a pruning parameter (-p 0.001). The required genome.satellite.bed and ge- nome.gap.bed files were prepared with in-house scripts from the Re- peatMasker v.4.0.7 output. The second step of VariationHunter analysis was the selection of variants from the created clusters. Thiswasperformed with amismatch score (-ms 0.1) to increase the penalty for reads that were not mapping perfectly; additionally, a heuristic algorithm (-wh) was used with the conflict resolution version (-cr) instead of the greedy algorithm, since this algorithm preferred calls that had reads with decreased multiple mapping, and for reads that had multiple mapping, the mapping with a lower edit distance was preferred. A high number of calls were produced as an initial output (-t 10,000) that were subsequently pruned based on the supporting reads information. Additionally, only regions with an average edit distance (AvgEditDits)# 3 were retained. Eventually, all insertion calls were removed after applying the common filter (Supplemental Table 1) because they were shorter than the lower size threshold. Pindel Pindel v.0.2.5b8 (Ye et al., 2009) was used for CNV detection (deletions, insertions, and tandemduplications) in individual samples fromBWA-MEM alignments of paired-end reads with the following parameters. The max- imum size of the structural variations and the window size were set to the default values (-x 5 -w 10), the balance cutoff was set to 0 (-B 0), and the median of the insert size was calculated for each sample (see above). All insertion callswere shorter than 500 bp, and theywere eventually removed with the common filter (Supplemental Table 1). Genome STRiP BWA-MEM alignments of all 1064 samples were used as input for GenomeSTRiPv.2.00.1774 (Handsaker etal., 2015). Thesoftware required the precomputing of referencemetadata based on the ArabidopsisTAIR10 genome sequence, as described in the software documentation (http:// software.broadinstitute.org/software/genomestrip/node_ReferenceMetadata. html). All required information was generated according to this docu- mentation except for the lcmask.fasta file (low-complexity mask), where the regions marked as Low complexity, Satellites, and Simple repeat were obtained from RepeatMasker results. Additionally, the TAIR10 ref- erence sequence contained ambiguous nucleotides, which were not permitted by the CNVDiscoveryPipeline script. Therefore, the positions with nucleotides other than A, C, G, T, or Nwere changed toN andmasked in the genome alignability mask (svmask file) by our own scripts. CNV discovery inGenomeSTRiPwasperformedwith twoseparatemodes,both of which were preceded by summary metadata computations (SVPre- process script). This step was run with the default values. Large deletions were then identified in the entire population using the SVDiscovery script with the minimum (-minimumSize) and maximum (-maximumSize) event sizes set to 500 and 1,000,000, respectively. The SVDiscovery pipeline scanned the genome for polymorphic sites with large deletions only. The methodwas initially seededwith aberrantly spaced readpairs andused the read depth as secondary support for the variant sites. All types of CNVs (biallelic duplications, biallelic deletions, and multiallelic variants) were detected separately with the CNVDiscoveryPipeline script in the entire population with the following parameters: -tilingWindowSize 1000, -ti- lingWindowOverlap 500, -maximumReferenceGapLength 1000, -boun- daryPrecision 100, and -minimumRefinedLength 500. The CNVDiscovery Pipeline script implemented a pipeline for discovering CNVs by seeding basedonthe readdepthof thecoverage.CNVs thatpassed throughall read signature filters were retained. The outputs of both pipelines were treated as separate data sets. Variant Merging and Breakpoint Refinement for CNV Discovery The CNVs were merged, and the breakpoints were refined as follows. (1) Within-tool merge. Variants $0.5 kb detected in individual samples by CNVnator andControl-FREECweremerged separately for each caller and for each CNV type (gains and losses) with 50% reciprocal overlap as acriterion.CNVsdetected in fewer than twoaccessionsweresubsequently discarded. This step eliminated the initial data redundancyandenabled the subsequent comparison of population-based and sample-based CNV calls. (2) Inter-toolmerge. A union of all CNVsdetectedwith readdepth and hybrid approaches was created by combining the merged-CNVnator, merged-Control-FREEC, Genome STRiP-CNV pipeline, and Genome STRiP-SV pipeline outputs. To remove redundancy, the variants were merged using reciprocal overlap $80% as a criterion, which resulted in 34,366 CNVs. (3) CNV breakpoint refinement. The breakpoints of the merged variants were refined by prioritizing the information obtained from the most accurate methods. Individual variants from BreakDancer, Var- iationHunter, and Pindel that reciprocally overlapped themerged CNVs by at least 80%were used in this step (Supplemental Table 2). If any variants called by the hybrid method (which combines information from the split reads and discordant read pairs at the population level) supported the merge, the maximal coordinates of these variants were used. For the re- maining CNVs, if the split read–based variants supported the merge, the maximal coordinates of these variants were used. For anyCNVs remaining after this step, if any discordant read pair–based variants supported the merge, themaximal coordinatesof thesevariantswereused.Finally, for the CNVs that still remained, theaveragedboundariesof the variantspredicted by read depth–based methods were set. (4) CNV selection. We selected 19,003 high-confidence CNVs (supported by two or more different callers) for the final AthCNV data set (Supplemental Table 1). Unless otherwise indicated, these CNVs were analyzed further. Variant Merging and Breakpoint Refinement for Large Indel Discovery Large indels weremerged, and the breakpoints were refined as follows. (1) Within-toolmerge. Variants 50 bp to 499 bp detected in individual samples by BreakDancer and VariationHunter were merged separately for each caller with 80% reciprocal overlap as a criterion. Variants detected in fewer than two accessions were subsequently discarded. This step eliminated the initial data redundancy. (2) Inter-tool merge and breakpoints re- finement. Variants overlapping each other by at least 80% were merged and their breakpointswere set by prioritizing the information obtained from the most accurate methods, in the same manner as for CNVs. As a result, we obtained 70,137 variants. Detection of CNVs in the KBS-Mac-74 Genome Assembly The KBS-Mac-74 genomic assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads was downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive Genome AssemblyDatabase (PRJEB21270; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ PRJEB21270).Wealigned this assembly to the referencegenome (TAIR10) with the nucmer aligner in the MUMmer package (Marçais et al., 2018), followed by variant detection with Assemblytics (Nattestad and Schatz, 2016).

CNV Genotyping with Genome STRiP SVGenotyper The genome STRiP SVGenotyper module was used to genotype genes in each accession. Prior to genotyping, the nonunique segments in the reference genome were identified by creating subsequence strings with 40-bpslidingwindowsanda1-bpstepandaligning themwith the reference genome; the nonunique segments were masked. This approach was shown to be successful for distinguishing between highly similar paralogs and resulted in more accurate genotyping (Handsaker et al., 2015). All variants in the input vcf files were marked with a SVTYPE tag specifying a general copy number variant (“CNV”). The genotyping failed for 4 of 1064 accessions, and these data were removed. We ultimately obtained the genotyping data for 26,845 genes. A comparison of the unrounded copy numbers and integer copy number genotypeswith the results of theMLPA assays for a subset of CNV-genes indicated that the copy number gen- otypes were frequently not correctly assigned by the SVGenotyper. Therefore, we did not use the genotype confidence filter integrated into the software. Instead, a custom filter based on the unrounded copy number distribution in the Col-0 accession was used to mark and remove outliers, defined as genes falling below (lower quartile minus 3* SD) value or above (upper quartile plus 3* SD) the value of the copy number range distribution in this accession. The threshold values were calculated separately for CNV- genes, genes overlapped by low-confidence CNVs, and NONVAR-genes. This step resulted in 7031 CNV-genes (5517 of them had at least 50% overlap with the CNVs), 4482 genes overlapped by low-confidence CNVs (2874 overlapped by at least 50%), and 14,877 genes not overlapped by any CNVs in the genotyping data. Annotation and Analysis of CNV-Genes The centromere positions were defined as described previously (Clark et al., 2007). The genes and noncoding elements in the CNV regions were located usingAraport 11 annotations (Cheng et al., 2017). GOanalysiswas performed with Panther Tools (Panther database v.13.1; Mi et al., 2013). The classification of the gene duplication types (tandem versus block) and gene family specificity analysis were conducted based on information retrieved from the Plaza v.4.0 database (Van Bel et al., 2018). For PCA, 1050 CNV-genes were manually selected based on the distribution of the copy number genotypes (at least two visibly distinguishable copy number classes) and the genomic location (one CNV-gene represented one AthCNV variant; selected AthCNVs were located throughout the entire genome:390 inchromosome1 [Chr1],153 inChr2,203 inChr3,129 inChr4, and 175 in Chr5). The analyses were performed with the R-3.5.0 package prcomp(). Graphical representations of CNVs and genes in the genome were prepared with IGV v.2.3.90 (Robinson et al., 2011), circos-0.69.6 (Krzywinski et al., 2009), and TAIR Chromosome Map Tool (https://www. arabidopsis.org/jsp/ChromosomeMap/tool.jsp). SNP Analysis SNPdata (1001genomes_snp-short-indel_only_ACGTN_v3.1.vcompared withsnpeff file) were downloaded from the 1001 Genomes Project server. PLINK v.1.90b3w program (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) was used for data preprocessing. Only SNPdata for 1060 accessions for which we also had CNV genotyping data were used. Variants with missing call rates exceeding value 0.5 as well as variants with minor allele frequency below 3% were filtered out. The LD parameter for linkage disequilibrium- based filtration was set as follows: –indep-pairwise 200’kb’ 25 0.3. The resulting117,232SNPswereused forPCAanalysiswithEIGENSOFTv.7.2. 1 (Price et al., 2006). Theggbiplot andggplot2 packageswere used for data visualization in the R version 3.6.1 environment. Genome-Wide Association Study of CNV Data Defense-related phenotypes (Atwell et al., 2010) were downloaded from the Arapheno database (Togninalli et al., 2019). For the genome-wide association study, we treated all copy number genotypes #1 as losses, all copynumber genotypes>3asgains, andall the remaining genotypes as unchanged. After filtering the CNV-gene data set with a 1% minor allele frequency threshold, 2519 CNV-genes remained in the analysis. Input files were preprocessed with PLINK v.1.90b3w. The IBS kinship matrix was calculated using SNPs for 1060 accessions. Association analysis was performed for each phenotype using a mixed model correcting for pop- ulation structure using Efficient Mixed-Model Association eXpedited, version emmax-beta-07Mar2010 (Kang et al., 2010). To declare the threshold for significant association, we used Bonferroni correction. Re- sults were further processed using the qqman package in R. Experimental Procedures Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis seedswere obtained fromTheNottinghamArabidopsis Stock Centre. The seedswere surface-sterilized, vernalized for 3 d, and grownon Jiffy pellets in ARASYSTEM containers (BETATECH) in a growth chamber (Percival Scientific). A light intensity of 175 mmolm22 s21 with proportional blue, red, and far red light was provided by a combination of fluorescent lamps (Philips) and GroLEDs red/far red LED Strips (CLF PlantClimatics). Plants were grown for 3 weeks under a 16-h light (22°C)/8-h dark (18°C) cycle, at 70% RH, with nourishment from Murashige and Skoog medium, 0.53 (Serva). A list of accessions used in the experiments is available in Supplemental Data Set 7. DNA Extraction and MLPA Assays DNAwas extracted from leaves with a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The MLPA assays were performed as described previously (Samelak-Czajka et al., 2017) using 5 ng of DNA template with the SALSAMLPA reagent kit FAM (MRC-Holland). The MLPA products were separated by capillary electrophoresis in an ABI Prism 3130XL analyzer at the Molecular Biology Techniques Facility in the Department of Biology at Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland. The results were analyzed with GeneMarker v.2.4.2 (SoftGenetics). Whenever possible, to minimize the risk of in- corporating SNPs and indels thatmight affect the probe hybridization step for some accessions, the MLPA probes were designed within regions of minimal sequence variation, as verified by examining vcf files for 1135 accessions obtained from the 1001 Genomes Project website (1001 Genomes Consortium et al., 2016). The genomic target sequence coor- dinates for the MLPA probes are provided in Supplemental Table 7. Protein Extraction and Quantification Proteins were extracted using the phenol method (Hurkman and Tanaka, 1986). The protein pellet was solubilized in 100 mM ammonium bi- carbonate for2hwith threecyclesof sonicationusingasonicbathevery0.5 h. The protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For quantification, 10 mg of total protein was reduced, al- kylated, and digested with trypsin (Luczak et al., 2016). Each sample was prepared for digestion in duplicate. For each run, 1.5 mg of protein digest was subjected to nano-liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrom- etry analysis using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 chromatograph and a Q-Ex- activeOrbitrapmass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) as described previously (Luczak et al., 2016).
