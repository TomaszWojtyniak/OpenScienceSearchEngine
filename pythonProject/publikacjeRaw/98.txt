Presently, our ability to predict global-scale changes to coral reef calcification is limited by insufficient data relating seawater carbonate chem- istry parameters to in situ rates of reef calcification. Here, we investigate natural trends5 in carbonate chemistry of the Davies Reef flat in the central Great Barrier Reef on diel and seasonal timescales and relate these trends to benthic carbon fluxes by quanti- fying net ecosystem calcification (nec) and net community production (ncp). Results show that seawater carbonate chemistry of the Davies Reef flat is highly variable over both diel and seasonal timescales. pH (total scale) ranged from 7.92 to 8.17, pCO210 ranged from 272 to 542 µatm, and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) ranged from 2.9 to 4.1. Diel cycles in carbonate chemistry were primarily driven by ncp, and warming explained 35 % and 47 % of the seasonal shifts in pCO2 and pH, respectively. Day- time ncp averaged 36±19 mmol C m−2 h−1 in summer and 33±13 mmol C m−2 h−1 in winter; nighttime ncp averaged −22±20 and −7±6 mmol C m−2 h−1 in summer and15 winter, respectively. Daytime nec averaged 11±4 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 in summer and 8±3 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 in winter, whereas nighttime nec averaged 2±4 mmol and −1±3 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 in summer and winter, respectively. Net ecosystem calci- fication was positively correlated with Ωarag for both seasons. Linear correlations of nec and Ωarag indicate that the Davies Reef flat may transition from a state of net calcifica-20 tion to net dissolution at Ωarag values of 3.4 in summer and 3.2 in winter. Diel trends in Ωarag indicate that the reef flat is currently below this calcification threshold 29.6 % of the time in summer and 14.1 % of the time in winter. 7642 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

Approximately 30 % of the carbon dioxide emitted each year into the atmosphere is5 absorbed by the world’s surface oceans, causing a shift in the seawater carbonate chemistry (Canadell et al., 2007; Sabine et al., 2011). On entry into the ocean, CO2 reacts with seawater via the following net chemical reaction: H2O+ (CO2)aq+CO 2− 3 → 2HCO− 3 . (1) As a result, concentrations of aqueous carbon dioxide, [CO2]aq, and bicarbonate,10 [HCO−3 ], increase, while the concentration of carbonate, [CO 2− 3 ], and the pH of seawater decrease (Broecker et al., 1979; Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Sabine et al., 2004); this process is referred to as ocean acidification. Since preindustrial times, CO2 uptake by the surface ocean waters has lowered seawater pH by approximately 0.1 units, which equates to an increase in acidity (i.e., the hydrogen ion concentration) of approximately15 30 %. Carbonate ion concentrations in surface waters have simultaneously decreased by 11 % and 15 % in the tropics and Southern Ocean respectively (Orr et al., 2005). Further reductions in pH of 0.3–0.5 units are projected by the end of this century as the oceans continue to absorb anthropogenic CO2 (Sabine et al., 2004; IPCC, 2007). A decrease in [CO2−3 ] results in a decrease in the saturation state of calcium carbon-20 ate (CaCO3), defined as: Ω= [Ca2+][CO2− 3 ]/K ′sp, (2) where K ′sp is the solubility product for a particular mineral phase of CaCO3 (e.g. arag- onite, calcite). Aragonite is the dominant biogenic form of CaCO3 secreted by many reef-building organisms, including corals. If Ω> 1, seawater is supersaturated with re-25 spect to CaCO3, and conditions are favorable for CaCO3 precipitation; conversely, if 7643 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

The surface waters of the tropical oceans are currently supersaturated with respect to aragonite (Ωarag =4.0±0.2, mean±SD); however, Ωarag has steadily de- clined from a calculated 4.6 ±0.2 one-hundred years ago and is expected to continue declining to 3.1±0.2 by the year 2065 and 2.8±0.2 by 2100 (Kleypas et al., 1999).5 Experimental results and models suggest that increases in atmospheric CO2 and the associated declines in [CO2−3 ] and Ωarag of the ocean’s surface waters will reduce rates of calcification on coral reefs (Gattuso et al., 1999; Langdon et al., 2000; Langdon and Atkinson, 2005; Anthony et al., 2008). Simultaneously, rates of bioerosion (Tribollet et al., 2009) and dissolution (Halley and Yates, 2000) are expected to increase. Because10 reef growth ultimately depends on the balance between constructive (e.g. CaCO3 de- position) and destructive (e.g. bioerosion, dissolution, etc.) processes, there is concern that corals may be approaching a critical threshold, beyond which their ability to effec- tively form reefs will be severely compromised. Presently, our ability to predict global- scale changes to coral reef calcification is limited by insufficient data relating pCO2,15 pH, [CO2−3 ], and/or Ω to in situ rates of reef calcification. Ocean acidification projections are based on trends from data collected in open ocean environments (Doney et al., 2009; Feely et al., 2009; Zeebe et al., 2012) and their implications for shallow, near-shore environments, such as coral reefs, are poorly understood. Coral reefs can naturally experience large fluctuations in seawater carbon-20 ate chemistry on both diurnal (Ohde and van Woesik, 1999; Shamberger et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2012) and seasonal (Bates et al., 2010; Gray et al., 2012) timescales. The coral reef carbon cycle is mainly driven by two biological processes, organic carbon metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) and inorganic carbon metabolism (cal- cification and dissolution). The extent to which these processes alter the carbonate25 chemistry of the overlying water column is a function of numerous environmental fac- tors, including benthic community composition (Anthony et al., 2011), biological activity (which can vary with temperature, light and nutrient availability), physical forcing (e.g. temperature, salinity), tidal regime, water depth, and residence time (Falter et al., 2008, 7644 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

As a result, chemical conditions can vary from reef to reef and often differ from open ocean conditions. For example, Shaw et al. (2012) demonstrated that pCO2 and pH values on the Lady Elliot Island reef flat (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) can range from preindustrial values (∼100 µatm pCO2 and pH 8.6) to future ocean acidification scenarios (∼1300 µatm pCO2 and pH 7.6) over the course of a day. Understanding the5 significance of ocean acidification projections in the context of this background variabil- ity is imperative to gauging the susceptibility of reef ecosystems to projected changes in ocean chemistry. An increasing number of studies are characterizing in situ trends in seawater car- bonate chemistry and calcification rates in natural reef communities to develop rela-10 tionships between carbonate parameters and biological processes; these relationships are used to estimate ‘thresholds’ at which reef systems transition from net accretion to net dissolution. To date, studies indicate that thresholds vary between reefs (Silverman et al., 2009; Shamberger et al., 2011), substrate types (Yates and Halley, 2006), and years (Yates and Halley, 2006), complicating our ability to predict global trends. pCO215 thresholds for the Eilat Reef in the Red Sea are estimated to be as low as 560 ppm (Silverman et al., 2009) while reefs in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii are not expected to dis- solve until pCO2 reaches nearly 900 µatm (Shamberger et al., 2011). More studies investigating natural community responses and relationships between in situ carbon- ate chemistry and fundamental biological processes are required to develop accurate20 predictions of the effects of ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems. Here, we investigate natural trends in carbonate chemistry of the Davies Reef flat (central Great Barrier Reef) on both diel and seasonal timescales. We relate these trends to benthic carbon fluxes by quantifying net ecosystem calcification (nec) and net community production (ncp). Automated water samplers were deployed to document25 diel cycling in reef carbonate chemistry, and nec and ncp were measured using a Lagrangian approach. Relationships between nec and Ωarag are calculated to estimate the threshold Ωarag value at which the Davies Reef flat transitions from net calcification to net dissolution. 7645 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

The reef is located approximately 90– 100 km Northeast of Townsville, Queensland. Davies Reef is approximately 6 km long5 and 2.7 km wide; the reef flat faces the SE direction, and is approximately 300 m wide. The prevailing wind direction is from the southeast, and the tidal regime is semidiurnal. Current behaviour on the reef flat is determined by the interaction of wind, tide and surface slope (Frith, 1983). Water flow across the reef flat is tidally dominated when the wind speed falls below ∼10 knots. Tidal reversals occur such that reef flat currents10 flood from the lagoon to the reef crest and ebb from the crest to the lagoon (Frith, 1983). There is a wet season during summer from approximately November through April and a dry season during winter from approximately May through October. 2.2 Water sampling and analysis 2.2.1 Fixed stations15 An automated water sampler (Fig. 2) was deployed on the protected (lagoonal) side of the reef flat (Fig. 1) to document diurnal variability in reef flat carbonate chemistry. The approximate depth of the water sampler was 0.5 m but varied with tides. The sampler was programmed to collect discrete water samples at 2 h intervals, by pumping reef water into pre-poisoned (0.05 % HgCl2 by volume to inhibit biological activity; Dickson,20 2007) 250 mL borosilicate bottles. Bottles were filled with reef water at a flow rate of ∼2 mL s−1 (∼2 min per sample). The sampler was programmed to flush the lines for 30 s prior to filling a new sample bottle to avoid contamination of new samples with “old” water. Bottles were retrieved every 12 h and new, pre-poisoned bottles were deployed. 7646 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

This method involves measuring5 total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) immediately before a parcel of water traverses the reef flat and immediately downstream of the reef community. The change in AT and CT was corrected for the transit time and water depth profile to produce a net rate at which the community altered the chemistry of the overlying water column (Eqs. 3, 4, 5). This method is limited to environments that experience10 unidirectional flow of water, and it has been widely applied to reef flats that experience unidirectional flow during incoming/outgoing tides or due to waves breaking across a reef crest (Langdon et al., 2010). If the study site consists of biological zones that are broad and perpendicular to the direction of water flow, lateral mixing is considered an insignificant source of error (Langdon et al., 2010).15 Lagrangian transport was measured by following water parcels using a small boat and a hand-held GPS (2–5 m precision) to record the location of the parcel as it tra- versed the reef flat. Water parcels were identified using fluorescein dye during the day and drifters (60 cm tall and 75 cm wide) at night. Discrete water samples were taken in duplicate at the beginning and end of each transect. Samples were taken in 250 mL20 borosilicate bottles filled at the water’s surface and immediately poisoned with 125 µL HgCl2 (0.05 % by volume) to inhibit biological activity. Water depth was measured using a hand-held depth sounder alongside of the dye patch/drifter at regular intervals along each transect and averaged. Transects were repeated many times over the course of several days in order to develop a composite diel curve of calcification and production.25 7647 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

Accuracy was checked against certified seawater refer- ence material (from A. Dickson, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Batch 106). pCO2, pHT (total scale), and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) were calculated as a function of the measured salinity, temperature, AT, and CT using the program CO2SYS (from E. Lewis, Brookhaven National Laboratory/Lewis and Wallace, 1998); dissociation con-10 stants for carbonate and boric acid determined by Mehrbach et al. (1973) as refit by Dickson and Millero (1987), and the dissociation constant for boric acid determined by Dickson (1990). 2.2.4 Physical conditions Temperature, light (PAR at 0.8 m depth), and wind data were obtained from the AIMS15 Weather Station at Davies Reef (http://data.aims.gov.au/), and salinity data were ob- tained from the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS 2012). 2.3 Calculations Changes in seawater carbon chemistry between upstream and downstream sampling points can be used to calculate net ecosystem calcification (nec) and net community20 production (ncp) rates. In most coral reef systems, changes in total alkalinity (AT) are caused primarily by calcification and dissolution of CaCO3 whereby two moles of AT are consumed (produced) for every mole of CaCO3 produced (dissolved).

Net commu- nity production, ncp, (mmol C m−2 h−1) can be calculated using changes in CT after taking into account nec and gas exchange: ncp = −hρ (∆CT −0.5∆AT) ∆t −kS (pCO2w−pCO2a) (4) where ∆CT is the change in dissolved inorganic carbon between the upstream and10 downstream locations (mmol kg−1), and the term kS(pCO2w−pCO2a) approximates gas exchange where k is the gas transfer velocity, S is the solubility of CO2 calcu- lated as a function of salinity and temperature, and (pCO2w−pCO2a) is the difference in pCO2 between the surface ocean and the atmosphere. All other parameters are defined as above. The wind speed parameterization of Ho et al. (2006) was used to15 calculate k, which ranged from 5.8 to 16.7 cm h−1, with a mean of 10.3 cm h−1. Result- ing gas exchange estimates were small in comparison to ncp, ranging from −0.11 to 0.13 mmol C m−2 h−1. Because gas exchange averaged 0.32 % of ncp (ranging from 0 % to 1.9 %), this term was treated as negligible, simplifying the equation to the follow- ing:20 ncp = −hρ (∆CT −0.5∆AT) ∆t (5) Pearson’s correlations were computed to assess the relationship between nec and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag). 7649 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

The exponential function y =a[1-exp(−x / b)]+ c] produced the best fit for the productivity- irradiance curve, and the calcification-irradiance curve was modeled using a linear5 function. 2.5 Benthic community structure Benthic surveys were conducted in both summer and winter to characterize the under- lying community structure of the reef flat site. Five, 200 m transects were laid on the reef flat perpendicular to the reef front, spaced 50 m apart. Photographs were taken of10 0.5 m2 quadrats at 5 m intervals (40 photos per transect). Photos were analyzed using Coral Point Count software with excel extensions (CPCe) using 20 random points per quadrat. The benthos was assigned to one of five main categories: (1) live coral; (2) algae (including macroalgae, turf, and cyanobacteria); (3) coralline algae (CCA); (4) CaCO3 substrate including sand, CaCO3 rock (e.g. old, dead coral), and/or rubble (i.e.,15 substrate with the potential to undergo dissolution); (5) and “other”, including sponges, gorgonians, zoanthids, giant clams, etc. Where morphologic forms of CaCO3 (e.g. rub- ble, CaCO3 rock) were covered with biologically active groups (e.g. turf, coralline algae, cyanobacteria), the biologically active group was scored. 7650 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

Winds were predominantly from the East/Southeast and averaged 12±3 knots (ranging from 4–19 knots). The tidal height ranged from 0.5– 3.4 m.

All values are mean ±1 SD. 3.2 Diel patterns in seawater carbonate chemistry15 CT and pCO2 were highest just before dawn, following a steady increase through- out the night and lowest just before dusk following a steady decrease during the day (Fig. 3). Diel patterns in pHT and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) mirrored those for CT and pCO2 but with highs at dusk and lows at dawn (Fig. 3).

Details of Lagrangian transects are given in Table 2. 3.3.1 Summer5 Net ecosystem calcification (nec) ranged from 5 to 17 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 during the day, averaging 11±4 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1. At night, nec ranged from −3 to 7 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1, averaging 2±4 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1. There was a positive correla- tion between nec and Ωarag, Pearson r = 0.522, n = 16, p = 0.038 (Fig. 8). Average net daily calcification, based on a 12 : 12 light dark cycle, was 6.5 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1.10 Net community production (ncp) ranged from 9 to 62 mmol C m−2 h−1 during the day, averaging 36±19 mmol C m−2 h−1. At night, ncp ranged from −50 to 1 mmol C m−2 h−1, averaging −22±20 mmol C m−2 h−1 (i.e., net respiring). 3.3.2 Winter Net ecosystem calcification (nec) ranged from 2 to 14 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 during the15 day, averaging 8±3 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1. At night, nec ranged from −4 to 4 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1, averaging −1±3 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 (i.e. net dissolution). There was a strong positive correlation between nec and Ωarag, Pearson r = 0.497, n = 29, p = 0.006 (Fig. 8). Average net daily calcification, based on a 12 : 12 light dark cycle, was 3.5 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1, approximately half that of summer.20 Net community production (ncp) ranged from 1 to 52 mmol C m−2 h−1 during the day, averaging 33±13 mmol C m−2 h−1. At night, ncp ranged from −14 to 5 mmol C m−2 h−1, averaging −7±6 mmol C m−2 h−1 (i.e. net respiring), and approximately a third of the summer rate. 7652 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

These ranges are consistent10 with those reported for other studies of extensive shallow-water reef flat systems (Shaw et al., 2012, Table 3). Diel cycles of pCO2 and Ωarag are largely driven by rates of primary production (Anthony et al., 2011; Kleypas et al., 2011; Shamberger et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2011) such that photosynthetic uptake of CO2 during the day results in an elevated saturation state when calcification is at its highest (Fig. 5). This coupling15 of primary production and calcification is shown in Fig. 7. While the light-dark cycle fundamentally controls the phase of the diel carbonate cycle via primary production, the amplitude of the cycle is influenced by a variety of factors including benthic community composition, tidal regimes, water depth, and residence time. The effect of tides on the amplitude of diel cycling is highly visible in Fig. 4b. The larger of the two mixed diurnal20 tides resulted in greater changes in Ωarag, while the smaller diurnal tide resulted in a dampened signal. Seasonal variability in pHT, pCO2, and Ωarag is the result of both physical pro- cesses (e.g. temperature forcing) and biological processes driving variation in nec and 7653 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

Temperature effects were examined using sensitivity analyses whereby in situ pHT, pCO2, temperature, and salinity were used as input parameters to the program CO2SYS (Lewis and Wallace, 1998), and pHT and pCO2 were recorded as outputs at the mean seasonal temperature (see Gray et al., 2012). Temperature-adjusted data indicate that 0.03 units of the 0.06 pHT unit seasonal change (47 %) (Table 1) and 19 µ5 atm of the 56 µatm seasonal pCO2 change (35 %) were due to cooling from 28.5 ◦C in summer to 22.3 ◦C in winter. 4.2 Diel and seasonal variation in biological activity In general, nec and ncp increased throughout the day and decreased into the evening (Fig. 5). The reef flat generally showed positive nec during the day and negative nec10 at night. Daytime nec and ncp were slightly higher in summer than in winter, a finding that is consistent with numerous prior studies (e.g. Shamberger et al., 2011, Table 2). Net calcification continued at low rates at night in summer, but net dissolution occurred at low rates at night in winter. Net ecosystem calcification was positively correlated to Ωarag with similar relation-15 ships observed for both summer and winter (Fig. 8). These findings are consistent with previous studies that report no seasonal effect on the relationship between nec and Ωarag (Langdon and Atkinson, 2005; Shaw et al., 2012). Ωarag explains 25–27 % of the variance in nec (Fig. 8). While we did not observe values of Ωarag lower than 2.9, disso- lution occurred at night in waters that remained supersaturated with respect to calcium20 carbonate. Dissolution in supersaturated waters has been reported previously in other reef systems (Yates and Halley, 2006) and is believed to be the result of undersatura- tion in pore waters, bioerosion of sediments by endolithic microbes and boring forams, and/or dissolution of more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (e.g. high-Mg calcite) (Yates and Halley, 2006; Santos et al., 2012).25 Average nighttime respiration in summer (-22±20 mmol C m−2 h−1) was approxi- mately 3-fold higher than in winter (−7±6 mmol C m−2 h−1). This difference was primar- ily driven by two night transects in summer that yielded anomalously high respiration 7654 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

One of these transects was conducted at approximately 00:30 h, and the other was conducted at approximately 19:40 h (Fig. 5b). While these rates are high in comparison to the other nighttime data from this study, comparable rates of nighttime respiration have been reported for the Kaneohe Bay barrier reef (Shamberger et al., 2011), and we have little reason to believe that these transects are5 unrepresentative. By omitting the two anomalous transects, summer nighttime respira- tion ranged from −19 to 1 mmol C m−2 h−1, averaging −10 mmol C m−2 h−1, which are comparable to winter values. Assuming a 12 : 12 light dark cycle, the average net daily nec was 6.5 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 in summer and 3.5 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1 in winter. When scaled up,10 these values yield a net daily calcification rate of 156 mmol (15.6 g) CaCO3 m −2 d−1 in summer and 84 mmol (8.4 g) CaCO3 m −2 d−1 in winter and an annual calcification rate of 4.27 kg CaCO3 m −2 yr−1 (assuming 0.5 yr or 178 days at each net rate). This an- nual calcification rate is consistent with the average calcification rate of 4±0.7 kg m−2 CaCO3 yr −1 reported to occur widely in Indo-Pacific coral reef flat environments (Kin-15 sey, 1985). The average summer daytime net calcification in this study, 11±4 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1, is also similar to values reported for GBR sites with comparable coral cover during similar times of year; Silverman et al. (2012) reported average sum- mer daytime net calcification for the One Tree Island reef flat (13.7 % coral cover) as 11.4±7.4 mmol CaCO3 m −2 h−1.20 4.3 Historical comparisons Assessing historical trends in reef community metabolism is often complicated by a lack of baseline data, including data on changes in benthic community composition. Nonetheless, at least two recent studies conducted on the Great Barrier Reef address long-term trends in carbon cycling on coral reefs. Carbon turnover rates of the One25 Tree Island reef were originally studied in the 1970s and 1980s (Kinsey, 1978, 1979) and more recently by Silverman et al. (2012). Silverman et al.

In contrast, Shamberger et al. (2011) report rates of net ecosystem calcification for reefs in Kaneohe Bay that are comparable to values reported from the 1970s. These findings were surprising given that pCO2 was substan- tially lower and Ωarag was higher in the 1970s (Kinsey, 1985).5 The results of this study are partly consistent with the results of Barnes (1983, 1988) whereby seasonality in community productivity and calcification were evalu- ated by floating an instrument package carrying pH and oxygen electrodes across the Davies Reef flat. Barnes reported seasonal variations in productivity and calcifi- cation of the Davies Reef flat, with net productivity averaging 45 % higher, and net10 calcification averaging 30–40 % higher in summer than in winter (Barnes, 1988). Daily net calcification rates of the reef flat were 16 g CaCO3 m −2 d−1 in summer (1981) and 11.9 g CaCO3 m −2 d−1 in winter (1984), compared to 15.6 g (summer) and 8.4 g (winter) CaCO3 m −2 d−1 in the present study. Barnes also reported higher rates of respiration in summer, an observation that is consistent with the present study. Barnes attributed15 the seasonality in community productivity to seasonal shifts in community composition, whereby epilithic algal blooms occurred in summer and died in winter. Seasonal shifts in algal biomass (or other benthic community groups) were not observed in the present study. The seasonal differences in community metabolism measured here are likely due to the warmer temperatures in summer driving higher rates of calcification and produc-20 tivity. Other contributing factors may have been light and/or nutrients; in the present study, average noontime irradiance was slightly higher in summer (1099 µmol m−2 s−1) than winter (908 µmol m−2 s−1). Nutrient levels were not measured, however, and can- not be excluded as a source of seasonal differences. In Barnes’ study, both light and temperature were elevated in summer and may have also been a contributing factor to25 the seasonal differences that were reported; however, the influence of these factors on seasonal differences was not addressed. Differences in methodology and technology preclude a robust assessment of changes in reef metabolism over time. However, these studies indicate that while some 7656 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

Vectors indicate the theoretical effects of photosynthesis-respiration and calcification-dissolution on AT and CT: for every mol of organic carbon produced (via photosynthesis), one mol of CT is consumed, and AT remains unchanged; for every mol of CaCO3 produced (calcification), AT decreases by 2 mol and CT decreases by 1 mol. Because photosynthesis-respiration (ncp) and10 calcification-dissolution (nec) affect AT and CT differently, the slope of the AT–CT re- lationship indicates the balance between these two processes (i.e. the nec:ncp ratio). The nec : ncp ratio is given by 1 [(2/m)−1] , where m is the slope of the AT–CT line. The slope of the omega isopleths in Figure 6 is approximately 0.93 in AT–CT space, which corresponds to a nec:ncp ratio of 0.87. Generally, if the slope of the AT–CT relationship15 approximates the slope of the omega isopleths, biological activity shifts points along a given isopleth and does not alter the saturation state of the overlying water column. Alternatively, if the AT–CT relationship crosses the isopleths (i.e. the slope of the AT–CT relationship is less than the slope of the isopleths), biological activity will increase the saturation state during the day and decrease the saturation state during the night. The20 slopes of the AT–CT relationships for Davies Reef are 0.37 and 0.46 for summer and winter, respectively, which correspond to nec:ncp ratios of 0.23 for summer and 0.30 for winter, indicating that daytime biological activity increases the saturation state of the water with time. The slope of the AT–CT relationship may prove a valuable indictor of reef function because it reflects the balance between calcification and production;25 phase shifts (e.g. from coral-dominated to algal-dominated systems) and/or significant 7657 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

The Ωarag values at which the trend-lines cross zero on the y-axis5 indicate “thresholds” at which the community transitions from net calcification to net dissolution. The corresponding Ωarag thresholds for summer and winter are 3.39 and 3.23, respectively. It should be noted, however, that only 25–27 % of the variation in nec is explained by Ωarag so thresholds are associated with substantial error. Figure 4 shows the diurnal variation in Ωarag by season. Using this data, we have estimated10 the percentage of time that Ωarag naturally falls below the threshold for net calcification (according to Yates and Halley, 2006). Accordingly, ambient Ωarag is below the calcifi- cation threshold for the Davies Reef flat 29.6 % of the time in summer and 14.1 % of the time in winter. Based on this relationship, one would expect more nighttime disso- lution in summer than in winter (Fig. 4). We observed dissolution in 2 out of 6 summer15 nighttime transects; however, average mean nighttime calcification was positive. This may indicate a deviation from the above relationship or a lack of replication for night- time transects in summer. Thresholds can provide a valuable tool to assess ecosystem function on individual reef scales; however, threshold values can vary widely between reefs (Shamberger et al., 2011), substrate types (Yates and Halley, 2006), and years20 (Yates and Halley, 2006), rendering generalizations complicated at best. As ocean acidification drives the gradual decline of CO2−3 and Ωarag, mean values of incoming water masses will lower. Consequently, the percentage of time spent below threshold values (favoring reef dissolution) will increase and the percentage of time spent above threshold values (favoring reef accretion) will decrease, driving changes25 in the overall carbon budget on reefs. This assumes that relationships between CO2−3 , Ωarag, and community calcification hold as we move into the future and that reef or- ganisms demonstrate little capacity to acclimatize and/or adapt to changing chemical 7658 http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-print.pdf http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/10/7641/2013/bgd-10-7641-2013-discussion.html http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ BGD 10, 7641–7676, 2013 Dynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry R.

Presently, our understanding of the ability of reef organisms to acclimatize and/or adapt to ocean acidification is poorly developed. Additional field studies are needed that re- late trends in reef carbonate chemistry to rates of calcification in natural settings; such studies will help establish ocean carbon chemistry baselines that will inform future5 change and will assist the development of predictive capabilities to assess the future of coral reefs in a changing environment.
