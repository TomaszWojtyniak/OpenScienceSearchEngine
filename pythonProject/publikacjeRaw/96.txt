[1] The atmospheric chemistry of iodine is important for several reasons, including the influence of iodine oxides on the oxidising capacity of the troposphere, the formation of new particles, and the enrichment of iodine in marine aerosols and the transport of this essential dietary element to the continents. It is shown here that a substantial iodine source is I2, most likely emitted from macro-algae at low tide. This source accounts for the daytime production of new particles in the coastal marine boundary layer, and also explains the discovery of significant night-time levels of iodine oxides.

Introduction [2] Recent observations of the iodine oxides IO [Alicke et al., 1999; Allan et al., 2000a] and OIO [Allan et al., 2001] in the marine boundary layer (MBL) have demonstrated the importance of iodine chemistry in the atmosphere. Iodine affects the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere in at least three ways. First, the iodine oxides are involved in ozone- depleting cycles in the troposphere [Davis et al., 1996; McFiggans et al., 2000] and stratosphere [Solomon et al., 1994]. Second, IO is an efficient oxidiser of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) [Nakano et al., 2003], which is emitted by phytoplankton in the ocean. Third, the uptake of inor- ganic iodine compounds, such as HOI and INO3, on sea-salt aerosols liberates chlorine and bromine into the gas phase; these halogens are also ozone-depleting and their atoms and oxides are highly reactive towards certain organic com- pounds [McFiggans et al., 2002]. Another aspect of iodine chemistry is that the higher iodine oxides, such as I2O5, condense from the gas phase very readily, and this may explain the substantial bursts of new particles in the daytime marine atmosphere [O’Dowd et al., 2002]. [3] The surprisingly high levels of iodine oxides that have been observed are partly explained by the discovery that a range of alkyl iodides (e.g., CH2I2, CH2ICl, CH3I) evade from the ocean, and then photolyse readily to produce I atoms and hence IO by reaction with O3 [Carpenter et al., 1999]. However, even though the rapid cycling of iodine compounds through sea-salt particles back into the gas phase helps to maintain the concentration of IO [Vogt et al., 1999], the source of alkyl iodides does not seem to be sufficient [McFiggans et al., 2000]. In this paper we will demonstrate that molecular iodine, I2, is another major source of atmospheric iodine. 2. DOAS Measurements of Iodine Species [4] Observations of I2, OIO, IO and NO3 (the nitrate radical) were made at the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station on the west coast of Ireland (53�200 N, 9�540 W) during August 2002. The concentrations of these species were measured by the technique of Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) [Allan et al., 2000a; Allan et al., 2000b; Allan et al., 2001]. The DOAS instru- ment consists of a Newtonian telescope housing both the transmitting and receiving optics. An absorption path, 8.4 km long and about 20 m above the sea, was set up by installing an array of corner-cube reflectors on an island 4.2 km west of the observatory [Allan et al., 2000a]. The light beam, powered by a 450 W xenon arc lamp, was folded back to the receiver and then directed through a quartz fibre optic bundle to a 0.5 m Czerny-Turner spectrometer (Acton Research model SP-556-i, grating 1200 grooves mm �1 ), and dispersed onto a two-dimension- al charge coupled detector (Princeton Instruments model NTE2, front-illuminated chip with an open electrode struc- ture). A spectral resolution of 0.25 nm was employed in the three wavelength ranges used for this study. [5] Spectra of the atmospheric light beam, scattered sunlight, and the xenon lamp, were recorded every 10 s and averaged for 30 min (I2, OIO and IO) or 20 min (NO3) to produce a differential absorption spectrum. Details of the spectral deconvolution procedure are provided elsewhere [Allan et al., 2000a; Allan et al., 2000b]. Literature refer- ence spectra for OIO [Himmelmann et al., 1996], IO [Harwood et al., 1997] and NO3 [Yokelson et al., 1994] were adapted to the spectrometer instrument function. The I2 reference cross section was measured in our laboratory at a pressure of 1 atm N2 and at a resolution suitable for DOAS retrievals [Saiz-Lopez et al., 2004], in contrast to the last study reported in the literature [Tellinghuisen, 1973]. The spectrum is available from the corresponding author on request. [6] Figure 1 shows examples of reference spectra for these molecules that have been fitted to atmospheric spectra, after other known absorbers in the atmosphere (e.g., NO2 and H2O) have been subtracted out. The top panel shows the clear identification of I2 from the band structure of its B 3�(0u + ) � X1Sg+ electronic transition. Note that I2 and OIO were measured simultaneously in the 535–575 nm wave- length region, IO in the 425–448 nm region, and NO3 in the GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 31, L04112, doi:10.1029/2003GL019215, 2004 Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union. 0094-8276/04/2003GL019215 L04112 1 of 4 640–768 nm region. It should be noted that the mixing ratios reported here are averaged over the optical path. 3. Results and Discussion [7] The DOAS instrument normally operated in a single spectral region for each daytime or night-time period. Figure 2 illustrates a selection of observations from 34 days of near-continuous measurements. Panels (a) and (b) show night-time and daytime measurements of I2 and OIO; panel (c) shows data on IO. The respective tidal heights are also plotted in these panels. Panel (d) illustrates two nights of NO3 measurements. [8] The I2 mixing ratio varied from below the instrumen- tal detection limit of about 3 parts per trillion by volume (ppt), to maximum levels of 93 ppt at night and 25 ppt during the day. As shown in Figure 2a, the I2 mixing ratio exhibited large pulses that were highly correlated with low tide. This behaviour, observed over 16 nights and 3 days of measurements, is most likely due to strong emissions of I2 from exposed macro-algae at low tide. For example, Laminaria kelp accumulates high concentrations of I � ions from seawater, which become oxidised to hypoiodous acid (HOI) and I2 in the plant [Kupper et al., 1998; Truesdale and Canosamas, 1995]. Previous work has shown that elevated levels of alkyl iodides, such as CH3I, CH2ICl and CH2I2, also occur in the coastal MBL at low tide [Carpenter et al., 1999]. Notwithstanding the strong corre- lation with tidal state, significant I2 levels (up to 25 ppt at night) were also observed at high tide in westerly winds. This may indicate that atmospheric I2 is also produced over the open ocean, possibly by the reaction of O3 with iodide ions in the sea surface microlayer [Garland and Curtis, 1981]. [9] During the day, the rapid photolysis of I2 (photolytic lifetime �10 s, determined in our laboratory) indicates that, on a local scale, there will be a substantial production of iodine oxides at low tide. This could well be responsible for Figure 1. Examples of atmospheric spectral fits. The black line is the atmospheric optical density (OD) spectrum with all the known absorbers (apart from the species of interest) fitted and subtracted; the grey line is the fitted reference OD spectrum of the final species. This procedure yields: a. [I2] = 88.5 ± 4.1 ppt; b. [OIO] = 2.5 ± 0.4 ppt; c. [IO] = 3.0 ± 0.4 ppt; d. [NO3] = 11.5 ± 0.4 ppt. Figure 2.

During these bursts, the observed rate of production of 3 nm-sized particles can reach about 5 � 104 particles cm�3 s�1. Assuming that each of these particles contains about 500 I2O5 molecules, then this requires an I atom formation rate of 5x10 7 cm �3 s �1 . This rate would be produced by the daytime photolysis of about 10 ppt of I2, typical of the daytime mixing ratios observed at low tide during the campaign. [10] The night-time mixing ratios of OIO ranged from below the detection limit (�0.5 ppt) to a maximum of 3 ppt. OIO is mainly produced by the self reaction of IO [Allan et al., 2001]. However, it has a large photolysis cross section between 500 and 620 nm, so that during the day its lifetime is only about 1 s [Ashworth et al., 2002]. Indeed, throughout the campaign OIO was not observed above the detection limit during daytime (see Figure 2b(ii)). In accord with our previous measurements [Allan et al., 2001], OIO sometimes exhibited a small peak immediately after sunset, when its photolysis ceased; it then disappeared over about 1 h, probably due to uptake on aerosol. However, when a significant pulse of I2 occurred at night, OIO built up to a peak about 2 h later (Figure 2b(i)). This clear correlation between I2 and OIO, the time lag between them, and the fact that the mixing ratio of I2 is at least an order of magnitude larger than that of OIO, strongly suggests that I2 is the source of the OIO. We consider this further below. [11] The mixing ratios of IO ranged from below the detection limit (�0.5 ppt) to a maximum of 7 ppt. As shown in Figure 2c(ii), the daytime IO mixing ratio usually peaked around low tide, as has been reported previously [Alicke et al., 1999]. However, during this campaign we also measured IO on two nights. Figure 2c(i) shows one of these nights where IO was clearly above the detection limit, peaking at 3 ppt around midnight. Figures 2c(i) and (ii) both show the pulse of IO that typically occurred for about an hour after dawn. This is most likely caused by the rapid photolysis of the inter-halogen species IBr and ICl [McFiggans et al., 2002; Vogt et al., 1999]. These species can build up during the night, following the uptake of inorganic iodine species such as INO3 and HOI on sea-salt aerosol [Mössinger and Cox, 2001]. [12] An intriguing question raised by the night-time observations reported here is how IO and OIO are generated in the absence of sunlight. As discussed above, the iodine source is most likely I2. Although the gas-phase reaction between O3 and I2 is too slow [Vikis and Macfarlane, 1985] to be important in the MBL, the reaction between NO3 and I2 has a reasonably fast rate constant (k = 1.5 � 10�12 cm3 molecule �1 s �1 at 285 K [Chambers et al., 1992]), and is assumed to yield INO3 and I [Atkinson and Wayne, 2000]. Atomic I would then react rapidly with O3 to form IO. Figure 2d shows the NO3 mixing ratio measured during two nights when air masses arrived at Mace Head from the oceanic sector (west/northwest wind direction), conditions similar to those when I2, OIO and IO were measured in Figures 2a–2c. NO3 mixing ratios averaging 7 ppt were observed under these conditions [Allan et al., 2000b]. At night in relatively clean air, the main loss process for IO is probably recombination with NO2 to form INO3 (k = 4.0 � 10 �12 cm 3 molecule �1 s �1 at 285 K [Allan and Plane, 2002]). During the night shown in Figure 2c(i), the average NO2 mixing ratio (measured in the same spectral region as IO) was 70 ppt. Taking I2 and NO3 mixing ratios of 50 and 7 ppt, respectively, then the steady-state mixing ratio of IO would be 2 ppt, which is in sensible accord with the observed levels. [13] The iodine oxides, at the mixing ratios measured in this environment, have a significant impact on the oxidising capacity of the MBL. The average rate of O3 depletion, catalysed by the IO self-reaction [McFiggans et al., 2000], ranged from about 0.06 ppb h �1 at night to 0.11 ppb h �1 during the day. These rates of O3 loss are significant when compared, for instance, to observed daytime loss rates of 0.3–0.4 ppb h �1 during summer at Cape Grim (Tasmania), another remote coastal location [Ayers et al., 1992]. IO has also been shown recently to react more rapidly with DMS than previously measured [Nakano et al., 2003]. Taking the average daytime IO mixing ratio of 3 ppt, and an average OH mixing ratio of 0.06 ppt measured during summer at Mace Head [Carslaw et al., 1999], shows that IO will oxidise DMS about 3 times faster than OH in this environment. [14] In summary, the present work has demonstrated that large concentrations of I2 can occur in the coastal MBL. The clear correlation of I2 with tidal state indicates that emissions from exposed macro-algae are responsible. A crude estimate of the contribution of coastal emissions of I2 to the global iodine budget can be made by assuming that all the emission occurs within the DOAS optical path (i.e., 4.2 km offshore), and that at every low tide a 1 km high boundary layer is filled with 50 ppt of I2 (based on the night-time measurements when I2 is not rapidly removed by photolysis). This corre- sponds to 1.5 Mg I yr �1 , per km of coastline. Assuming that 20% of the earth’s total coastline (1.6 � 106 km) lies within temperate latitudes where I2-producing macro-algae are abundant, then the integrated flux is 0.5 Tg I yr �1 . This may be compared with estimates of 0.4–1.0 Tg yr �1 for the emission of I2 from the action of O3 at the sea surface [Garland and Curtis, 1981], and 1–2 Tg yr �1 for the global emission of CH3I from the ocean [Davis et al., 1996].
