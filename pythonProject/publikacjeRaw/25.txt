There are characterized uniformly non-l1n Banach spaces in terms of the upper modified n-th von Neumann– Jordan constant. Moreover, this constant is calculated explicitly for Lebesgue spaces L p and l p (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞). Finally, it is shown that the sequence of n-th upper and modified upper von Neumann–Jordan constants for the space L p as well as l p (2 < p < ∞) converges to B2p, where Bp is the best type (2, p) constant in the Khinthine inequality for the case 2 ≤ p < ∞.

The symbol l p m (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, m ∈ N∪ {∞}) stands for m-dimensional Lebesgue sequence space. Clearly, l p ∞ = l p. In 1937 Clarkson [5], on the basis of the famous paper [13] by Jordan and von Neumann, introduced the constantCN J (X) (called the von Neumann–Jordan constant or NJ-constant for short) as the smallest constant C ≥ 1 such that 1 C ≤ ‖x + y‖ 2 X + ‖x − y‖2X 2 (‖x‖2X + ‖y‖2X ) ≤ C holds for any x, y ∈ X with ‖x‖2X + ‖y‖2X > 0. An equivalent and more convenient definition of NJ-constant is given in [15] by the formula CN J (X) = sup { ‖x + y‖2X + ‖x − y‖2X 2 (‖x‖2X + ‖y‖2X ) : x ∈ S(X), y ∈ B(X) } . The classical Jordan and von Neumann results [13] state that 1 ≤ CN J (X) ≤ 2 for any Banach space X and CN J (X) = 1 if and only if X is a Hilbert space. Clarkson [5] showed that if 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and dim L p(μ) ≥ 2, then CN J (L p(μ)) = 22/min{p,q}−1, where 1/p + 1/q = 1. Kato and Takahashi [16], observed that CN J (X) = CN J (X∗). Moreover, they proved that if theBanach space X is uniformly convex, thenCN J (X) < 2 and if CN J (X) < 2, then X admits an equivalent uniformly convex norm. The same authors [16] state that the Banach space X is uniformly non-square if and only if CN J (X) < 2. Some results concerning relationships between von Neumann–Jordan and so called James constant have been obtained among others in [2,15,19,21,23,25]. A similar constant C ′ N J (X) = sup { ‖x + y‖2X + ‖x − y‖2X 4 : x, y ∈ S(X) } was introduced in 2006 by Gao [7] and called the modified von Neumann–Jordan constant. It is clear that C ′ N J (X) ≤ CN J (X). It has been shown that C ′ N J (X) does not necessarily coincide with CN J (X) (see [2,8]). These constants have been considered recently also in [22]. The von Neumann Jordan constant has been generalized in many directions (see e.g. [17,24,26]). To generalize the von Neumann–Jordan constant, denote C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X for any x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ X such that ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X > 0. 652 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik Definition 1 The smallest, resp., the largest constant C > 0 such that C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ≤ C, resp., C ≤ C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) (1) for all x j ∈ X , ( j = 1, 2, . . . , n and n ≥ 2) with ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X > 0 is called an upper, resp., lower n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant and denoted by C (n) N J (X), resp., C (n)N J (X). If the infimum, resp., supremum of C satisfying (1) is taken over all x j ∈ S(X), ( j = 1, 2, . . . , n and n ≥ 2), then it is called upper, resp., lower modified n- th von Neumann–Jordan constant and denoted by C (n) m N J (X), resp., C (n) m N J (X). It is well known that C (2) N J (X) = [ C (2) N J (X) ]−1 = CN J (X) (see [20]). As it is proved below, the equality C (n) N J (X) = [ C (n) N J (X) ]−1 is not true in general for n > 2. Moreover, C (2) m N J (X) = C ′N J (X) and C (n) m N J (X) need not be equal to [ C (n) m N J (X) ]−1 even for n = 2 (see [7]). The n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant introduced and investigated by Kato, Takahashi and Hashimoto in [17] is exactly the upper n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant. In 1964 James [12] introduced the notion of uniformly non-l1n Banach space. Namely, a Banach space X is called uniformly non-l1n if there exists δ > 0 such that for each n elements of the unit ball B(X) min θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ X ≤ n (1 − δ) (see [10]). The definition remains the same if we replace the unit ball B(X) by the unit sphere S(X). If X is uniformly non-l1n for n = 2, then it is called uniformly non-square. It is worth mentioning that uniform non-squareness plays a crucial role in fixed point theory, since any uniformly non-square Banach space has the fixed point property (for more details see [9]). In 1987 Kamińska and Turett [14] proved that the uniform non-l1n for Banach spaces is equivalent to the fact that there exists δ > 0 such that for all x1, x2, . . . , xn in X min θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ X ≤ ( 1 − δn min1≤i≤n ‖xi‖X∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ) n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X . Banach spaces that are uniformly non-l1n for a certain n ∈ N have been studied by A. Beck [3]. Such spaces are said to be B- convex. Beck [3] proved that a Banach space X is B-convex if and only if a certain strong law of large numbers is valid for random variables with ranges in X . Moreover, B-convexity is a very important property in fixed point theory because every B-convex uniformly monotone Köthe space has the fixed point property (see [1]). On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 653 2 Basic Properties Proposition 1 Let n ≥ 2 and X be a Banach space. The lower, upper, modified lower and modified upper n-th von Neumann–Jordan constants have the following proper- ties: (a) 1 ≤ C (n)m N J (X) ≤ C (n) N J (X) ≤ n and 1/n ≤ C (n)N J (X) ≤ C (n)m N J (X) ≤ 1; (b) C (n) N J (X) ≤ C (n+1) N J (X) and C (n+1) N J (X) ≤ C (n)N J (X); (c) C (n) m N J (X) ≤ n+1n C (n+1) m N J (X). Proof Let (X , ‖·‖X ) be a Banach space and n ≥ 2. (a) The estimation C (n) N J (X) ≤ n is proved in [17]. C (n) m N J (X) ≤ C (n) N J (X) by the definition. Putting x1 ∈ S(X) and xi = x1 for i = 2, 3, . . . , n, we have C (n)(x1, x1, . . . , x1) = 1 n2n−1 ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x1 ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X = 1 n2n−1 ∑n−1 j=0 ( n − 1 j ) ‖(n − 2 j)x1‖2X = 1 n2n−1 ∑n−1 j=0 ( n − 1 j ) (n − 2 j)2 = 1. Hence C (n) m N J (X) = sup { C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : xi ∈ S(X), i = 1, 2, . . . , n } ≥ 1 and C (n) m N J (X) = inf { C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : xi ∈ S(X), i = 1, 2, . . . , n } ≤ 1. Obviously, C (n)N J (X) ≤ C (n)m N J (X) by the definition. To prove that 1n ≤ C (n) N J (X), we use the mathematical induction principle. For n = 2 we have C (2) N J (X) = 1 C (2) N J (X) ≥ 1 2 . Suppose that C (n−1)N J (X) ≥ 1n−1 . Notice that ‖x + y‖2X + ‖x − y‖2X ≥ 2 ( max {‖x‖X , ‖y‖X })2 ≥ ‖x‖2X + ‖y‖2X (2) for any x, y ∈ X . Really, since ‖x + y‖X + ‖x − y‖X ≥ 2max {‖x‖X , ‖y‖X } = 2mx,y ≥ ‖x + y‖X − ‖x − y‖X 654 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik we have ‖x + y‖2X + ‖x − y‖2X ≥ ‖x + y‖2X + ( 2mx,y − ‖x + y‖X )2 = 2 ‖x + y‖2X − 4mx,y ‖x + y‖X + 4 ( mx,y )2 = 2 [ (‖x + y‖X − mx,y )2 + (mx,y )2 ] ≥ 2 (max {‖x‖X , ‖y‖X })2 ≥ ‖x‖2X + ‖y‖2X . Hence C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∑n j=1 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X 2n ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X = ∑ θ j =±1 ( ∥ ∥ ∥ ( ∑ j �=i θ j x j ) +xi ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X + ∥ ∥ ∥ ( ∑ j �=i θ j x j ) − xi ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X ) 2n ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X ≥ ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∑ j �=i θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X + 2n−1 ‖xi‖2X 2n ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X ≥ 2n−1 n−1 ∑ j �=i ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X + 2n−1 ‖xi‖2X 2n ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X = 1 n−1 ∑ j �=i ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X + ‖xi‖2X 2 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X = 1 n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X + n−2n−1 ‖xi‖2X 2 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X = 1 2 (n − 1) + (n − 2) ‖xi‖2X 2 (n − 1)∑nj=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X for any i = 1, 2, . . . , n. It follows that C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ≥ 1 n n ∑ i=1 ( 1 2 (n − 1) + (n − 2) ‖xi‖2X 2 (n − 1)∑nj=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X ) = 1 2 (n − 1) + n − 2 2n (n − 1) = 1 n and consequently C (n)N J (X) ≥ 1n , which finishes the proof of (a). On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 655 (b) The inequality C (n) N J (X) ≤ C (n+1) N J (X) is proved in [17]. To prove the second inequality it is enough to notice that C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = C (n+1)(x1, x2, . . . , xn, 0) for any elements x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ X . Hence C (n+1) N J (X) = inf { C (n+1)(x1, x2, . . . , xn, xn+1) : x1, x2, . . . , xn+1 ∈ X } ≤ inf { C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ X } = C (n)N J (X). (c) For any x1, x2, . . . , xn+1 ∈ S(X), by the inequality (2), we have C (n+1)(x1, x2, . . . , xn+1) = ∑ θ j =±1 ⎛ ⎝ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ( n ∑ j=1 θ j x j ) + xn+1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X + ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ( n ∑ j=1 θ j x j ) − xn+1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X ⎞ ⎠ (n + 1)2n+1 ≥ 1 (n + 1)2n ∑ θ j =±1 max { ∥ ∥ ∥ ∑n j=1 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X , ‖xn+1‖2X } ≥ 1 (n + 1)2n ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∑n j=1 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X = n n + 1C (n) (x1, x2, . . . , xn), whence C (n) m N J (X) ≤ n+1n C (n+1) m N J (X). � Proposition 2 Let n ≥ 2 and X be a Banach space. (a) The following conditions are equivalent: (i) X is a Hilbert space; (ii) C (n) N J (X) = 1; (iii) C (n)N J (X) = 1. (b) If X is a Hilbert space, then C (n) m N J (X) = C (n)m N J (X) = 1. Proof (a) By Theorem 5 (iii) in [17], conditions (i) and (ii) are equivalent. To prove the implication (i) ⇒ (iii) suppose that X is a Hilbert space. By elementary calculations, we get that C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = 1 (3) for any elements x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ X ,whenceC (n)N J (X) = 1.Conversely, ifC (n)N J (X) = 1, then, by Proposition 1 (a) and (b), we have 1 ≥ 1 CN J (X) = C (2)N J (X) ≥ C (n)N J (X) = 1. 656 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik Hence CN J (X) = 1. Consequently, X is a Hilbert space (see [13]). (b) follows immediately from (3). � In general, the explicit calculation of various types of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant is rather a hard problem. Anyway, the next proposition can be helpful to do this. Proposition 3 Let (X , ‖·‖X ) be a Banach space and n ≥ 2. Denote D1 = [B(X)]n \ {0}, D2 = B(l2n(X)) \ {0}, D3 = S(l2n(X)), where 0 = (0, 0, . . . , 0). Then C (n) N J (X) = sup { C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ D j } (4) and C (n) N J (X) = inf { C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ D j } (5) for any j = 1, 2, 3. Proof Since S(l2n(X)) ⊂ B(l2n(X)) \ {0} ⊂ [B(X)]n \ {0} ⊂ Xn \ {0}, it follows that sup x∈D3 C (n)(x) ≤ sup x∈D2 C (n)(x) ≤ sup x∈D1 C (n)(x) ≤ C (n)N J (X), where x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn). To show (4), it remains to prove that supx∈D3 C (n)(x) ≥ C (n) N J (X). Let x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Xn \ {0}. Define the sequence y = (yk)nk=1 by yk = xk ( ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X ) 1 2 for k = 1, 2, . . . , n and n ≥ 2. Obviously, y ∈ S(l2n(X)). Hence sup x∈D3 C (n)(x) ≥ C (n)(y) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥y1 + ∑n j=2 θ j y j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X 2n−1 = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X = C (n)(x) for any elements x ∈ Xn \ {0}. Therefore sup x∈D3 C (n)(x) ≥ sup { C (n)(x) : x ∈ Xn \ {0} } = C (n)N J (X) On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 657 which finishes the proof of (4). The equality (5) can be proved similarly. � Let n ≥ 2. Define A2 = [ 1 1 1 −1 ] 2×2 and for each integers n > 2 An = [ An−1 1 An−1 −1 ] 2n−1×n , where 1 denotes the 2n−2-by-1 column vector in which all the elements are equal to 1. The matrix An generates a linear operator Tn : l2n(X) → l22n−1(X) defined for any x ∈ l2n(X) by the formula Tn(x) = An x . Aone-to-one correspondencebetweenn-th vonNeumann–Jordan constantC (n) N J (X) and the norm of the operator Tn is given by the following result. Corollary 1 Let (X , ‖·‖X ) be a Banach space and Tn : l2n(X) → l22n−1(X) be the linear operator generated by the matrix An . Then C (n) N J (X) = ||Tn||2 2n−1 for any integer n ≥ 2. Proof Fix n ≥ 2. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ X and ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X > 0. Denote x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).

Then 658 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik (a) C (n)N J (X ∗) ≥ 1 C (n) N J (X) . (b) C (n)N J (X) ≥ 1C(n)N J (X∗) . Proof (a) Define an operator Tn : l2n(X) → l22n−1(X) as above. Let T ∗n be the adjoint of operator Tn . Obviously, T ∗ n : l22n−1(X∗) → l2n(X∗) is generated by the matrix A∗n = ATn . Then, by Corollary 1, we get 1 C (n) N J (X) = 2 n−1 ||Tn||2 = 2 n−1 ||T ∗n ||2 ≤ 2n−1 ‖y∗‖2 l2 2n−1 (X ∗) ∥ ∥T ∗n y∗ ∥ ∥ 2 l2n (X ∗) (6) for any y∗ = (y∗1 , y∗2 , . . . , y∗2n−1) ∈ l22n−1(X∗) \ {0}. Let S∗n = 1 2n−1 An . Then, Sn : l2n(X ∗) → l2 2n−1(X ∗). Since A∗n · 1 2n−1 An = In, where In is the identity matrix of size n × n, it follows that T ∗n ( S∗n x ∗) = x∗ for any x∗ = (x∗1 , x∗2 , . . . , x∗n ) ∈ l2n (X∗) . Hence, by (6), we have 1 C (n) N J (X) ≤ 2n−1 ∥ ∥S∗n x∗ ∥ ∥ 2 l2 2n−1 (X ∗) ∥ ∥T ∗n ( S∗n x∗ )∥ ∥ 2 l2n (X ∗) = ‖An x∗‖2l2 2n−1 (X ∗) 2n−1 ‖x∗‖2 l2n (X ∗) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x∗1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x ∗ j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X∗ 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥ ∥x∗j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X∗ = C (n) (x∗1 , x∗2 , . . . , x∗n ) for any (x∗1 , x ∗ 2 , . . . , x ∗ n ) ∈ (X∗)n \ {0}. By the definition of the lower n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant, we get the thesis of (a). (b) Since X can be isometrically embedded into X∗∗, it follows that C (n)N J (X) ≥ C (n) N J (X ∗∗). Hence, by (a), we have C (n) N J (X) ≥ C (n)N J (X∗∗) ≥ 1 C (n) N J (X ∗) . � The n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant for some classical Banach spaces can be calculated effectively. On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 659 Proposition 4 Let n ≥ 2. (a) If 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 and n ≤ m ≤ ∞, then C (n)N J (l pm) = C (n) m N J (l p m) = n 2 p −1. (b) If 2n−1 ≤ m ≤ ∞, then C (n)N J (l∞m ) = C (n) m N J (l ∞ m ) = n. (c) If n ≤ m ≤ ∞, then C (n)N J (l∞m ) = C (n)m N J (l∞m ) = 1n . (d) Let (Ω,Σ,μ) be a measure space with non-atomic σ -finite and complete measure μ. Then C (n) m N J (L 1 (μ)) = C (n)N J (L1(μ)) = C (n) N J (L ∞ (μ)) = C (n)N J (L∞(μ)) = n and C (n) m N J (L ∞ (μ)) = C (n)N J (L∞(μ)) = 1 n . Proof (a) Let n ≤ m ≤ ∞. By Theorem 3 (ii) in [17], C (n)N J (l pm) = n 2 p −1. By Propo- sition 1 (b), C (n) m N J (l p m) ≤ n 2 p −1. Taking the canonical basis (ei )mi=1 (n ≤ m ≤ ∞) in l p m, we get C (n) (e1, e2, . . . , en) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥e1 + ∑n j=2 θ j e j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 l p 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥e j ∥ ∥ 2 l p = n 2 p 2n−1 n2n−1 = n 2p −1. Since ei ∈ S(l pm) for i ∈ N ∩ [1, m], it follows that C (n) m N J (l p m) ≥ C (n) (e1, e2, . . . , en) = n 2 p −1. Hence C (n) m N J (l p m) = n 2 p −1. (b) Let 2n−1 ≤ m ≤ ∞.Then l∞m is not uniformly non-l1n .ByTheorem 5 (iv) in [17] and Proposition 1 (a), we conclude that C (n) N J (l ∞ m ) = n. To prove that C (n) m N J (l ∞ m ) = n take the matrix An defined as above. The column j of An denote by a (n) j . Then a(n)j = [1, a(n)2 j , . . . , a(n)2n−1 j ], where a (n) i j = ±1 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ n and 2 ≤ i ≤ 2n−1. Define for j = 1, 2, . . . , n, z j = 2n−1 ∑ i=1 a (n) i j ei , where (ei ) m i=1 (n ≤ m ≤ ∞) is the canonical basis in l∞m . Obviously, ∥ ∥z j ∥ ∥ l∞m = 1. Let (1, θ2, . . . , θn) be an arbitrary sequence such that θ j = ±1 for any 2 ≤ j ≤ n. 660 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik Then there is exactly one row i0 of An such that [1, θ2, . . . , θn] = [ a (n) i01 , a (n) i02 , . . . , a (n) i0n ] . Hence 1 + n ∑ j=2 θ j a (n) i0 j = n. Moreover ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 + n ∑ j=2 θ j a (n) i j ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ < n for any i �= i0.

Therefore n ≤ C (n)m N J (l∞m ) ≤ C (n) N J (l ∞ m ) = n, which completes the proof of (b). (c) Let n ≤ m ≤ ∞ and (ei ) be the canonical basis in l∞m . By Proposition 1 (a), we have 1 n ≤ C (n)N J (l∞m ) ≤ C (n)m N J (l∞m ) ≤ C (n) (e1, e2, . . . , en) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥e1 + ∑n j=2 θ j e j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 l∞m 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥e j ∥ ∥ 2 l∞m = 1 n . (d) Since L1(μ) contains an isometric copy of l1, applying Proposition 4 (a) for p = 1, we get n = C (n)m N J (l1) ≤ C (n) m N J (L 1 (μ)) ≤ C (n)N J (L1(μ)) ≤ n. On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 661 Hence C (n) m N J (L 1(μ)) = C (n)N J (L1(μ)) = n. Using the same arguments, by Propo- sition 4 (b) we conclude that C (n) N J (L ∞(μ)) = C (n)m N J (L∞(μ)) = n. Similarly, by Proposition 4 (c), we obtain 1 n ≤ C (n)N J (L∞(μ)) ≤ C (n)m N J (L∞(μ)) ≤ C (n)m N J (l∞) = 1 n , which completes the proof. � 3 Uniformly non-l1n spaces The next theorem gives some characterizations of the uniform non-l1n property for Banach spaces. Kato, Takahashi and Hashimito proved in [17] that (X , ‖·‖X ) is uni- formly non-l1n iff C (n) N J (X) < n. We will extend their results. Theorem 1 Let (X , ‖·‖X ) be a Banach space. Then the following conditions are equiv- alent: (a) C (n) m N J (X) < n; (b) (X , ‖·‖X ) is uniformly non-l1n; (c) There exists δ ∈ (0, 1) such that for any element (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ B ( l2n (X) ) , we have min θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ X ≤ √n(1 − δ); (7) (d) There exists δ ∈ (0, 1) such that for any element (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ S ( l2n (X) ) , the inequality (7) is satisfied. Proof (a) ⇒ (b). Suppose that C (n)m N J (X) < n. Then 1 2n−1 ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X ≤ nC (n)m N J (X) for any x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ S (X) . Since on the left hand side we have an arithmetic mean, there is at least one sequence (1, θ2, . . . , θn) such that ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X ≤ nC (n)m N J (X). 662 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik Hence min θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ X ≤ n √ C (n) m N J (X) n = n (1 − δ) , where δ = √ n− √ C (n) m N J (X)√ n . Consequently, (X , ‖·‖X ) is uniformly non-l1n . (b) ⇒ (c). Assume that (X , ‖·‖X ) is uniformly non-l1n . Let (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ B ( l2n (X) ) . Since ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X ≤ 1, it follows that min1≤ j≤n ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ≤ 1√ n . More- over, by the Hölder inequality, we have n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ≤ √n ⎛ ⎝ n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X ⎞ ⎠ 1/2 ≤ √n. (8) Case 1. Suppose that 1 2 √ n < min1≤ j≤n ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ≤ 1√ n . By the characterization of uniform non-l1n given in [14] and by the inequality (8), there is δ1 > 0 such that min θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ X ≤ ( 1 − δ1n min1≤i≤n ‖xi‖X∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ) n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ≤ ( 1 − δ1 √ n 2 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ) n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ≤ √n ( 1 − δ1 2 ) . Case 2. Suppose that 0 ≤ min1≤ j≤n ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X ≤ 1 2 √ n . Let xk be the element on which the minimum is taken. Then, by the Hölder inequality, we have ‖x1 ± x2 ± · · · ± xn‖X ≤ n ∑ j=1, j �=k ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ X + ‖xk‖X ≤ √ n − 1 √ √ √ √ n ∑ j=1, j �=k ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X + ‖xk‖X ≤ √ n − 1 √ 1 − ‖xk‖2X + ‖xk‖X for any choice of signs. Define f (t) = √ n − 1 √ 1 − t2 + t On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 663 for any t ∈ [ 0, 1 2 √ n ] . By elementary calculus, we conclude that f is an increasing function on the interval [ 0, 1 2 √ n ] . Hence, the function f (t) takes its highest value on [ 0, 1 2 √ n ] at the point t = 1 2 √ n . Thus, ‖x1 ± x2 ± · · · ± xn‖X ≤ √ n − 1 √ 1 − ( 1 2 √ n )2 + 1 2 √ n = 1 2 √ n ( √ (4n − 1) (n − 1) + 1 ) = √n ( 1 − (2n − 1) − √ (4n − 1) (n − 1) 2n ) for any choice of signs. Taking δ = min { δ1 2 , (2n − 1) − √(4n − 1) (n − 1) 2n } , we get (c). (c) ⇒ (d). It is obvious. (d) ⇒ (a). Let (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ S ( l2n (X) ) . By the assumption (d) there exists δ ∈ (0, 1) such that ‖x1 ± x2 ± · · · ± xn‖X ≤ √ n (1 − δ) for some choice of signs. Moreover, by (8), ‖x1 ± x2 ± · · · ± xn‖X ≤ √ n for any choice of signs. Hence, we have ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ 2 X ≤ n (1 − δ) 2 + n (2n−1 − 1) 2n−1 = n − δn (2 − δ) 2n−1 . By the definition of the upper n-th vonNeumann–Jordan constantC (n) N J (X) and Propo- sition 3, we conclude C (n) m N J (X) ≤ C (n) N J (X) ≤ n − δn (2 − δ) 2n−1 < n, which finishes the proof. � By Theorem 1 and the definition of B-convexity, we get immediately Corollary 3 A Banach space (X , ‖·‖X ) is B-convex if and only if there is n ≥ 2 (n ∈ N ) such that C (n) m N J (X) < n. 664 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik Notice that C (n) m N J (X) is not equal to C (n) N J (X) in general (for n = 2 see [18]). Corollary 4 C (n) m N J (X) = n if and only if C (n) N J (X) = n. Proof Since (X , ‖·‖X ) is uniformly non-l1n iffC (n) N J (X) < n, it follows, by Theorem 1, that C (n) N J (X) < n iff C (n) m N J (X) < n. Hence, by Proposition 1 (a), we get the thesis. � Remark 1 Let us notice that the above corollary can be reformulated equivalently as follows C (n) m N J (X) < n if and only if C (n) N J (X) < n. 4 Upper and lower n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant for Lp-spaces Now we will calculate the upper n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant for Lebesgue spaces L p(μ) and l p m (1 < p < ∞, 1 ≤ m ≤ ∞). To prove the next lemma, we will apply the following results given by Figiel, Iwaniec and Pełczyński in [6]. Namely, for arbitrary scalars c1, c2, . . . , cn and 2 < p < ∞ we have ∫ 1 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n ∑ j=1 c jr j (t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ p dt ≤ n−1 ∫ 1 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n ∑ j=1 r j (t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ p dt n ∑ j=1 ∣ ∣c j ∣ ∣ p , (9) where r1, r2, . . . , rn (n = 1, 2, . . .) are Rademacher functions, that is rn(t) = sign(sin 2nπ t) . Let �·� : R → Z be the floor function, i.e. �x� = max {k ∈ Z : k ≤ x} for any x ∈ R. Lemma 1 Let 2 < p < ∞ and X = L p(μ) or X = l p. Then ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ x1 + n ∑ j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ p X ≤ n−1 �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ p X for any x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ X and any integer n ≥ 1. Proof Fix an integer n ≥ 1. Notice that ∫ 1 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n ∑ j=1 c jr j (t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ p dt = 21−n ∑ θ j =±1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ c1 + n ∑ j=2 θ j c j ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ p for any scalars c1, c2, . . . , cn . On the other hand, it can be proved elementarily that ∫ 1 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n ∑ j=1 r j (t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ p dt = 21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p . On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 665 Suppose that xk = ( t (k) i )∞ i=1 ∈ l p for k = 1, 2, . . . , n. By the inequality (9), we get ∑ θ j =±1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ t (1) i + n ∑ j=2 θ j t ( j) i ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ p ≤ n−1 �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p n ∑ j=1 ∣ ∣ ∣t ( j) i ∣ ∣ ∣ p for any i ∈ N. Summing by sides from i = 1 to ∞ and reversing the order of summation, we obtain the thesis. Similarly, for X = L p(μ) take x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ L p(μ). Then, by the inequality (9), we get ∑ θ j =±1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ x1(t) + n ∑ j=2 θ j x j (t) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ p ≤ n−1 �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p n ∑ j=1 ∣ ∣x j (t) ∣ ∣ p for almost every t ∈ Ω. Integrating by sides this inequality and reversing the order of summation and integration, we obtain the desired inequality. � Theorem 2 Let 1 ≤ p < ∞ and X = L p(μ) or X = l pm (1 ≤ m ≤ ∞). Then C (n) m N J (X) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ n 2 p −1 if 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 and m ≥ n, n−1 ( 21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 (n k ) (n − 2k)p ) 2 p if 2 < p < ∞ and m ≥ 2n−1. Proof Case 1. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ 2. By Theorem 3 from [17] and Proposition 1 (a), for all n ≥ 2, we have C (n) m N J (X) ≤ C (n) N J (X) = n 2 p −1. whenever X = L p(μ) or X = l pm, m ∈ N ∪ {∞}. The opposite inequality follows immediately from Proposition 4 (a) whenever X = l pm with m ≥ n. Now consider X = L p(μ). Let A ⊂ Ω be a set of positive finite measure. Divide the set A into n pairwise disjoint subsets A1, A2, . . . , An such that n ⋃ i=1 Ai = A and μ(Ai ) = 1n μ(A). Define zi = μ(Ai )−1/pχAi for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Then ‖zi‖L p = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ ∫ Ai ( μ(Ai ) −1/p )p dμ ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ 1 p = 1 666 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik for any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and C (n) m N J (L p (μ)) ≥ C (n)(z1, z2, . . . , zn) = 1 n2n−1 ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ z1 + n ∑ j=2 θ j z j ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 L p = 1 n2n−1 ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ μ(A1) −1/p χA1 + n ∑ j=2 θ jμ(A j ) −1/p χA j ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 L p = 1 n2n−1 2n−1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ( 1 n μ(A) )−1/p χA ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 L p = 1 n [ μ(A) ( 1 n μ(A) )−1] 2p = n 2p −1. Hence C (n) m N J (L p(μ)) = C (n)N J (L p(μ)) = n 2 p −1, whenever 1 ≤ p ≤ 2. Case 2. Let 2 < p < ∞ and X = L p(μ) or X = l pm (2n−1 ≤ m ≤ ∞). By the Hölder-Rogers inequality for p > 2 and by Lemma 1, we have ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ x1 + n ∑ j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X ≤ 22(n−1) ( 1 2− 1p ) ⎛ ⎝ ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ x1 + n ∑ j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ p X ⎞ ⎠ 2 p ≤ 2(n−1) ( p−2 p ) ⎛ ⎝n−1 �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ p X ⎞ ⎠ 2 p (10) for any x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ X . Assume that x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ S(X). Then, by inequality (10), we have C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥x1 + ∑n j=2 θ j x j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 X n2n−1 ≤ 1 n2n−1 2 (n−1) ( p−2 p ) ⎛ ⎝n−1 �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p n ∑ j=1 ∥ ∥x j ∥ ∥ p X ⎞ ⎠ 2 p =1 n 2 (n−1) ( p−2 p −1 ) ⎛ ⎝ �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p ⎞ ⎠ 2 p =n−1 ⎛ ⎝21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p ⎞ ⎠ 2 p , On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 667 whence C (n) m N J (X) ≤ n−1 ⎛ ⎝21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p ⎞ ⎠ 2 p . (11) Let the matrix An be defined as in the proof of Proposition 3 (b).Denote by yi column i of the matrix An (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). For any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} define zi = 1 ( 2n−1 )1/p yTi , where yTi denotes the transpose of the column yi . Then ‖zi‖l p 2n−1 = ⎛ ⎝ 2n−1 ∑ m=1 ( 1 ( 2n−1 )1/p )p ⎞ ⎠ 1/p = 1 for any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} . Hence z1, z2, . . . , zn ∈ S ( l p 2n−1 ) . For any element x = (t1, t2, . . . , t2n−1) ∈ l p2n−1 denote by x∗ its non-increasing rearrangement, i.e. a non-increasing sequence obtained from {|ti |}2n−1i=1 by a suitable permutation of the integers. Notice that for all sequences (1, θ2, . . . , θn) such that θ j = ±1, ( j = 2, 3, . . . , n) the non-increasing rearrangements ( z1 + ∑n j=2 θ j z j )∗ coincide. Denoting by ( v1, v2, . . . , v2n−1 ) the non-increasing sequence such that ( z1 + ∑n j=2 θ j z j )∗ = (v1, v2, . . . , v2n−1 ) for any sequences (1, θ2, . . . , θn). Hence C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥z1 + ∑n j=2 θ j z j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 l p 2n−1 n2n−1 = 1 n ∥ ∥ ( v1, v2, . . . , v2n−1 )∥ ∥ 2 l p 2n−1 . Notice that v1 = n (2n−1)1/p , vl = n−2k (2n−1)1/p for (n k ) subsequent integers l, (k = 1, 2, . . . , �n/2�) . Consequently, 668 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik C (n) m N J ( l p 2n−1 ) ≥ C (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = 1 n ⎛ ⎝ �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) ( n − 2k ( 2n−1 )1/p )p ⎞ ⎠ 2/p = n−1 ⎛ ⎝21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p ⎞ ⎠ 2 p . Since l p 2n−1 can be embedded isometrically in any l p m with m ≥ 2n−1, by inequality (11) applied for X = l pm , it follows that C (n) m N J ( l p 2n−1 ) = C (n)m N J ( l p m ) = n−1 ⎛ ⎝21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p ⎞ ⎠ 2 p whenever 2 < p ≤ ∞ and m ≥ 2n−1. Since L p(μ) contains an isometric copy of l p 2n−1 , by inequality (11), we obtain the thesis for X = L p(μ), which completes the proof. � Haagerup [11] proved that the best type (2, p) constant in the Khinthine inequality for 2 ≤ p < ∞ is Bp = √ 2 ( 1√ π Γ ( p+1 2 )) 1 p . Kato, Takahashi and Hashimoto proved in [17] that C (n) N J (X) ≤ min { n 2 q −1, B2p } . Combining this result with Theo- rem 2, we get two hand side estimation of upper von Neumann–Jordan constant for Lebesgue spaces with p ∈ (2,∞). Corollary 5 Let 2 < p < ∞, q be conjugate to p and X = L p(μ) or X = l pm . If m ≥ 2n−1, then n−1 ⎛ ⎝21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p ⎞ ⎠ 2 p ≤ C (n)N J (X) ≤ min { n 2 q −1, B2p } . Proof The left hand side inequality follows immediately from Theorem 2. Namely, n−1 ⎛ ⎝21−n �n/2� ∑ k=0 ( n k ) (n − 2k)p ⎞ ⎠ 2 p = C (n)m N J (X) ≤ C (n) N J (X) , whenever 2 < p < ∞, X = L p(μ) or X = l pm and m ≥ 2n−1. The right hand side inequality was proved in [17]. � On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 669 Theorem 3 Let 2 < p < ∞. If X = L p(μ) or X = l p, then lim n→∞ C (n) m N J (X) = limn→∞ C (n) N J (X) = B2p. Proof Assume that 2 < p < ∞. By Theorem 2, for every n ∈ N , we get C (2n) m N J (X) = (2n)−1 ( 21−2n n ∑ k=0 ( 2n k ) (2n − 2k)p )2/p = 1 2n ( 2p+1 22n n ∑ k=0 ( 2n k ) (n − k)p )2/p = 2 1+2/p n ⎛ ⎝ 1 22n n ∑ j=0 ( 2n n − j ) j p ⎞ ⎠ 2/p , where j = n − k. On the other hand, by elementary asymptotic method (see [4]), we have ∑ | j |<x√n/2 1 22n ( 2n n − j ) = (1 + o(1)) ∑ | j |<x√n/2 1√ πn e− j 2/n for any x > 0. Hence, letting t j = j √ 2/n, we obtain ∑ | j |<x√n/2 1 22n ( 2n n − j ) = (1 + o(1)) ∑ |t j |<x 1√ 2π e −t2j /2Δt j for any x > 0. Passing to the limit gives the classic de Moivre–Laplace theorem (see [4]). In our case, we get n ∑ j=0 1 22n ( 2n n − j ) j p = (1 + o(1)) (n 2 )p/2 1√ 2π ∫ ∞ 0 e−t 2/2t pdt . (12) Moreover, by the definition of the gamma function, it follows that 1√ 2π ∫ ∞ 0 e−t 2/2t pdt = 1√ 2π ∫ ∞ 0 e−u(2u)(p−1)/2du = 2 p/2 2 √ π ∫ ∞ 0 e−uu(p−1)/2du = 2 p/2 2 √ π ∫ ∞ 0 e−uu ( p+1 2 ) −1 du = 2 p/2 2 √ π Γ ( p + 1 2 ) . 670 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik Thus, by the equality (12), we obtain C (2n) m N J (X) = 21+2/p n ⎛ ⎝ 1 22n n ∑ j=0 ( 2n n − j ) j p ⎞ ⎠ 2/p =2 1+2/p n ( (1 + o(1)) (n 2 )p/2 1√ 2π ∫ ∞ 0 e−t 2/2t pdt )2/p =n2 2/p n (1 + o(1))2/p ( 1√ 2π ∫ ∞ 0 e−t 2/2t pdt )2/p =22/p(1 + o(1))2/p ( 2p/2 2 √ π Γ ( p + 1 2 ))2/p =2(1 + o(1))2/p ( 1√ π Γ ( p + 1 2 ))2/p =(1 + o(1))2/p [√ 2 ( 1√ π Γ ( p + 1 2 ))1/p ]2 =(1 + o(1))2/p B2p for any n ∈ N. Hence lim n→∞ C (2n) m N J (X) = B2p. By Proposition 1 (a), (c) and Corollary 5, we have C (2n) m N J (X) ≤ 2n + 1 2n C (2n+1) m N J (X) ≤ C (2n+1) N J (X) ≤ B2p. By the squeeze theorem, it follows that lim n→∞ C (2n) m N J (X) = limn→∞ C (2n+1) m N J (X) = limn→∞ C (2n+1) N J (X) = B2p, whence limn→∞ C (n) m N J (X) = B2p. Furthermore, limn→∞ C (n) N J (X) = B2p because the sequence ( C (n) m N J (X) ) is increasing. � The proof of Theorem 3 presented here is a modification of idea given by Cecil Rousseau from The University of Memphis in private communication. Corollary 6 Let 2 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and X = L p(μ) or X = l pm . If m ≥ n, then C (n)N J (X) = n 2 p −1. On somemodifications of n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant… 671 Proof Let 2 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and q denote the conjugate number of p. By Corollary 2 and Theorem 2, we have C (n) N J (L p (μ)) ≥ 1 C (n) N J ((L p(μ))∗) = 1 C (n) N J (L q(μ)) = n1− 2q = n 2p −1. On the other hand, taking the canonical basis {ei }ni=1 in l p n we have C (n) (e1, e2, . . . , en) = ∑ θ j =±1 ∥ ∥ ∥e1 + ∑n j=2 θ j e j ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 l p n 2n−1 ∑n j=1 ∥ ∥e j ∥ ∥ 2 l p n = 2 n−1n 2 p 2n−1n = n 2p −1. Hence, by the definition of lower n-th von Neumann–Jordan constant, we get C (n) N J (L p (μ)) ≤ C (n)N J (l p m) ≤ C (n)N J (l p n ) ≤ n 2 p −1 whenever m ≥ n. Combining the both inequalities, we get the thesis. � Remark 2 It is known that CN J (X) = CN J (X∗) (see [16]) and in general C (n)N J (X) �= C (n) N J (X ∗) for n ≥ 3 (see [17]). Theorem 2 shows that C (2)m N J (X) = C (2) m N J (X ∗) whenever X = L p(μ) or X = l pm with m ≥ 2n−1. Really, fix 1 < p < 2 and consider X = L p(μ) or X = l pm with m ≥ 2n−1. Let q be conjugate to p. Then q > 2 and X∗ = Lq(μ) or X∗ = lqm with m ≥ 2n−1, respectively. Applying Theorem 2 for n = 2, we have C (2) m N J (X) = 2 2 p −1. Since q = pp−1 > 2, it follows from Theorem 2 that C (2) m N J (X ∗ ) = 1 2 ( 1 2 1 ∑ k=0 ( 2 k ) (2 − 2k) p p−1 ) 2(p−1) p = 1 2 ( 2 p p−1−1 ) 2(p−1) p = 2 2p −1, whence C (2) m N J (X) = C (2) m N J (X ∗). The equality C (n) m N J (X) = C (n) m N J (X ∗) does not hold in general for n ≥ 3. By Remark 9 (i i) in [17] and Theorem 2, we have 672 M. Ciesielski and R. Płuciennik C (n) m N J (X ∗ ) ≤ C (n)N J (X∗) < C (n) N J (X) = n 2 p −1 = C (n)m N J (X), whence C (n) m N J (X) �= C (n) m N J (X ∗) for n ≥ 3.
