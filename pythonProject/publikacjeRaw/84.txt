Total length (LT) ranged from 33 to 158 cm for females and 34 to 155 cm for males. No sexual dimorphism was evident in disc size (length or width) or in LT –mass relationships. The smallest mature female was 95 cm LT and the size at which 50% were mature (LT50) was 109 cm. Males matured between 80 and 90 cm LT with a LT50 of 88 cm. Although the largest Z. chilensis captured by the artisanal fishery was 155 cm LT, 89% of landings comprised relatively small, immature fish. This situation may compromise the stock integrity if intrinsic vulnerability and probable long-life span of Z. chilensis are considered. Consequences for the survival of the species and possible signs of a fishery collapse must be reviewed by management authorities by consideration of both artisanal and industrial landings in Chile. © 2011 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology © 2011 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: fishery management; size-at-maturity; yellownose skate. INTRODUCTION Skates are cartilaginous benthic fishes that occupy the same spatial niche as demer- sal teleosts, such as flatfishes, hakes and eels (Walker & Hislop, 1998). Unlike the majority of bony fishes, however, skates have intrinsic life-history patterns that make them highly susceptible to commercial over-exploitation (Dulvy et al., 2000; Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002; Frisk, 2010). Skates present unique challenges for fishery man- agement (Stevens et al., 2000) and conservation (Roberts & Hawkins, 1999; Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002) due to their low fecundity, late age at sexual maturity and relatively high longevity (Holden, 1977; Frisk et al., 2001). Over the last decade, evaluation of the conservation status of skates and rays in several geographic areas has estab- lished that commercially exploited species could be seriously threatened (Dulvy & ‡Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

For example, large declines in populations and local extinctions of North Atlantic Ocean skates, such as the common skate Dipturus batis (L. 1758), the barndoor skate Dipturus laevis (Mitchill 1818), the white skate Rostroraja alba (Lacépède 1803) and thornback ray Raja clavata L. 1758, have resulted from commercial fish- ing activities (Dulvy & Forrest, 2010). Resilience to fishing pressure varies among skate species, however, and while some populations have decreased dramatically (Brander, 1981; Iglésias et al., 2009), others have not, and, in some cases, may even have increased because of reorganization of ecological niches (Walker & Hislop, 1998; Dulvy et al., 2000; Dulvy & Forrest, 2010). The vulnerability of batoid pop- ulations is mostly assessed through the examination of fisheries catch trends (Dulvy et al., 2000), but in many South American countries, including Argentina (Massa & Hozbor, 2003), Brazil (M. C. Oddone, pers. obs.) and Chile (Lamilla et al., 2005), skates and rays have generally been recorded as a single unidentified category (e.g. rays, including rajoids and Myliobatiformes) in official fisheries records for several decades. From 2003, however, landings of the target species [the yellownose skate Zearaja chilensis (Guichenot 1848)] and by-catch (a combination of six other skate species) in the Chilean skate fishery have been recorded separately. Zearaja chilensis is the most commercially valuable batoid that inhabits the con- tinental slope of southern South America from Uruguay (south-western Atlantic Ocean) to central Chile (south-eastern Pacific Ocean) (Menni & López, 1984) and to the east of the Falkland Islands (Agnew et al., 2000). The first recorded landings of Z. chilensis in Chile were made in the early 1970s (Bahamonde et al., 1996). Since then, the catch effort for this species has gradually intensified especially in the small-scale coastal fleet located between Valdivia (40◦ S) and Aisén (45◦ S), which is considered an artisanal fishery by local management authorities (Licandeo et al., 2006). In addition to this target fishery, Z. chilensis is caught as by-catch in two industrial trawl fisheries: the southern hake Merluccius australis (Hutton 1872) fishery that operates south of 41◦ 28·6′ S (Quiroz et al., 2009) and the common hake Merluccius gayi (Guichenot 1848) bottom trawl fishery that operates between 34◦ 28′ S and 41◦ 28·6′ S (Gálvez et al., 1998). These artisanal and industrial fishing grounds do not overlap due to local management measures which restrict the target catch of Z. chilensis for industrial vessels to south of 41◦ 28·6′ S and 9·26 km (5 nautical miles) out into Chilean waters. According to official records, the annual national landing (from artisanal and industrial fleets) of Z. chilensis has increased from 1317 in 1990 to 3010 in 2007, with an average landing of 2663 for this period (SERNAP, 2007). After a biological closure was imposed on the artisanal fisheries in 2008, the annual landing by industrial fleets has averaged 1727 for 2008 and 2009 (SERNAP, 2009). Despite this closure, a fishing quota of 2307 and 642 were granted to the artisanal fishery during 2009 and 2010. Although size at maturity (Fuentealba et al., 1990; Bahamonde et al., 1996) and the life history of this species (Licandeo et al., 2006; Quiroz et al., 2009) have been determined previously, based on landings in southern bottom longline fishery grounds, there is a lack of information about the northern coastal artisanal fishery population. In order to provide additional information on the reproductive biology of Z. chilensis, sexual dimorphism was assessed and size at maturity was determined from the artisanal exploited stock. Further details of the sexual development of both males and females, as well as estimates of fecundity are also presented. © 2011 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology © 2011 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, Journal of Fish Biology 2012, 80, 1213–1226 R E P RO D U C T I V E B I O L O G Y O F Z E A R A JA C H I L E N S I S 1215 MATERIALS AND METHODS Zearaja chilensis landings were sampled from three localities in southern Chile: Queule (39·4◦ S), Corral (39·8◦ S) and Bahía Mansa (40·5◦ S) (Fig. 1), between September 2000 and December 2002. All specimens were caught by artisanal vessels of 6–15·5 m length using bottom-set longlines of 300–400 hooks (M/K No. 7). Total length (LT), disc width (WD) and length (LD) were recorded for each specimen following Hubbs & Ishiyama (1968) and Last et al. (2008), along with sex and left clasper post-cloacal length (LC). Measurements were made to the nearest cm. Total body mass (MT) and liver mass (ML) were determined for all Z. chilensis and recorded to the nearest gram. The hepato-somatic index (IH) was calculated as: IH = 100 (MLM−1T ). Ovary and oviducal-gland mass and maximum ovarian-follicle diameters were measured for females, while testes and epigonal organ mass were determined for males. All measurements are presented as the mean ± s.d. The χ2 goodness of fit (Sokal & Rohlf, 1987) was used to test whether the ratio of males to females varied significantly from a 1:1 ratio. Linear relationships between LT, partial lengths (LD and WD) and MT were fitted separately for sex and tested for sexual dimorphism using ANCOVA. Regressions were fitted to raw data, except for LT and MT, which were log10 18° (a) (b) 24° 30° 38° 42° 48° 54° 74° 0' 73° 45' 73° 30' 73° 15' 40° 45' N 40° 30' 40° 15' 40° 00' 39° 45' 39° 30' 74° 0' 73° 45' 73° 30' Queule Corral Argentina Bahía Mansa Chile 73° 15' Fig. 1.

Paired t-tests were performed to explore possible differences in left v. right ovary mass, oviducal-gland mass and ovarian-follicle size and number, and differences between epigonal organ and testes mass. Relationships between ovary–oviducal- gland mass and LT, and between LC and LT were used to further assess the onset of maturity (Capapé & Quignard, 1974; Restrepo & Watson, 1991). One-way ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in mean maximum ovarian-follicle diameter and IH in available months (September to December). Binomial maturity data (immature 0, mature 1) were determined by sex at 10 cm intervals. Size at maturity in both sexes were calculated by fitting the following logistic curve (by minimization of the least squares), to the relationship between the fraction of mature males or females as a function of LT, Y = [1 + e−(a+bX)]−1, where Y is the fraction of mature individuals in LT class X, and a and b are the model coefficients. The ratio a:b represents the size at which 50% of the fish were mature (Mollet et al., 2000; Oddone et al., 2005). Females were considered mature when vitellogenic (yellow) ovarian follicles and egg capsules were present (Chen et al., 1997; Oddone et al., 2005). Individual males with sperm in their seminal vesicles and calcified, rigid claspers were considered mature (Sosebee, 2005). All data analyses were performed using the freeware software PAST (Hammer et al., 2001), with significance accepted at P < 0·05. RESULTS C AT C H C O M P O S I T I O N A total of 5477 specimens were examined (2356 females and 3121 males). The catch composition sex ratio of 1:0·75 had a significant bias towards males (χ2 = 53·692, d.f. = 1, P > 0·001). Body size of females caught ranged between 33 and 158 cm LT (75·4 ± 12·6 cm); males ranged between 34 and 155 cm LT (85·4 ± 7·2 cm) (Fig. 2). The LT and MT relationship was influenced by sex (MT = 1e-05 L2·9165T in females and MT = 3e-05 L2·6614T in males), but no significant differences were observed between slopes (ANCOVA, F1,5202 = 0·293; P > 0·05) [Fig. 3(a)]. Size-related sexual dimorphism was not obvious despite significant differences when comparing slopes between LT and LD [ANCOVA, F1,5254 = 12·14; P < 0·001; Fig. 3(b)] or WD [ANCOVA, F1,4848 = 4586; P < 0·001; Fig. 3(c)]. The overall mass of catches was 24·6 tonnes with mean ± s.d. of 4530 ± 3625 g with a minimum of 800 g and maximum of 3800 g. L I V E R M E A S U R E M E N T S The mean ± s.d. IH was 5·135 ± 1·443 for males, and 5·157 ± 1·254 for females, with no significant differences observed between months (F4,244 = 10·17, P > 0·05) for either sex (Fig. 4). Significant differences were observed between IH of mature and immature males (t = −3·524, d.f. = 2802, P < 0·001) and between mature and immature females (t = −3·939, d.f. = 2064, P < 0·001), with relatively heavier livers present in mature specimens. There was no significant difference between overall mature male and female IH (t = 1·916, d.f. = 4074, P > 0·05).

Similarly, there were no significant differences between left (43·57 ± 38·65 g) and right (44·44 ± 40·24 g) oviducal-gland masses (t = 0·187, d.f. = 2132, P > 0·05). Significant differences were detected, however, in ovarian-follicle counts between left (142·91 ± 48·73) and right (163·26 ± 62·39) ovaries (t = 3·145, d.f. = 2368, P < 0·001). Ovarian follicles were 0·3–4·1 cm in diameter and 0·04–19·21 g in mass. No significant differences (t = 1·730, d.f. = 2110, P > 0·05) were observed between maximum diameters of ovarian follicles in left (3·38 ± 0·35 cm) and right (3·50 ± 0·43 cm) ovaries. The minimum size at first maturity occurred at c. 95 cm LT based on ovary and oviducal-gland mass [Fig. 5(a), (b)]. Substantial variations in ovarian-follicle mass were observed for follicles of the same diameter as a result of differences in yolk consistency [Fig. 5(c)]. Mean maximum ovarian-follicle diameter ranged from 3·45 ± 0·24 cm in September to 4·10 ± 0·43 cm in December, although no significant differences were observed between months [ANOVA, F3,273 = 4·0, P > 0·05; Fig. 4(a)]. The size at which 50% of the fish were mature (LT50) was 109 cm LT [Fig. 5(d)], and mature females represented only 8% of the female catch at this size. M A L E R E P RO D U C T I V E B I O L O G Y The LC varied markedly between mature specimens with the smallest mature male recorded at 62 cm LT, whereas some individuals were immature at c. 95 cm LT [Fig. 6(a)].

DISCUSSION The sex ratio in Z. chilensis was biased towards males, which suggests some sexual segregation in the study area although the reason for this is not known. Differences in sexual composition may be a consequence of behaviour, and many deep-sea skates are known to segregate by sex, size and maturity (Ebert et al., 2008). © 2011 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology © 2011 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, Journal of Fish Biology 2012, 80, 1213–1226 R E P RO D U C T I V E B I O L O G Y O F Z E A R A JA C H I L E N S I S 1219 4·5 6·0 5·5 5·0 4·5 4·0 I H 3·5 3·0 4·0 M ax im um o va ri an -f ol li cl e di am et er ( cm ) 3·5 3·0 2·5 Sept Oct Nov Month Dec Fig. 4.

In elasmobranchs, size is commonly regarded as a major secondary sexual char- acteristic, with females often larger and heavier than males (Cortés, 2000).

There may be a selective advantage for female Z. chilensis to grow to a larger size than males (Licandeo et al., 2006) in order to accommodate relatively large ova (that mature at c. 41 mm in diameter) and the associated reproductive tract. A large body size would in itself provide a large energy reserve to draw upon for egg production and may also influence the diet, by allowing larger and possibly dif- ferent species of prey to be taken as seen in other skate species (Brickle et al., 2003; Kyne et al., 2008). In some species, however, such as the ovoviviparous apron ray Discopyge tschudii Heckel 1846, the length–mass relationship and body size (mea- sured as disc width) indicate that males grow larger than females (García, 1984; Pequeño et al., 1988). A similar situation has also been reported for Bathyraja inter- rupta (Gill & Townsend 1897), Bathyraja minispinosa Ishiyama & Ishihara 1977 and Bathyraja parmifera (Bean 1881) (Ebert, 2005), as well as for Leucoraja wallacei © 2011 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology © 2011 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, Journal of Fish Biology 2012, 80, 1213–1226 R E P RO D U C T I V E B I O L O G Y O F Z E A R A JA C H I L E N S I S 1221 (Hulley 1970), Raja straeleni Poll 1951, Raja barnardi (Norman 1935) and Raja leopardus (von Bonde & Swart 1923) (Ebert et al., 2008). Pequeño et al. (1988) argued that this could be an adaptation to activities such as mating or swimming behaviour in those species that undergo significant migrations. It is also common to find that size-at-maturity varies according to sex, with males commonly reaching maturation at smaller sizes than the females (Wetherbee, 1996; Ellis & Shackley, 1997; Girard & Du Buit, 1999). In Z. chilensis, males matured at c. 80% of the size at maturity of females, but Mabragaña et al. (2002) suggest that this dimorphism could be due to local ecological characteristics rather than to biological peculiarity. The IH was significantly larger in mature fish compared to immature specimens in both sexes, which is presumably correlated with larger energy reserves in ani- mals in which growth has slowed. Interestingly, while female elasmobranchs often have larger livers than males, due to requirements for egg and yolk development (Quiroz et al., 2011), these differences are not reflected in the present findings. Unlike mature males, the liver of mature females produces vitellogenin, the pre- cursor protein molecule of vitellogenic material during the oocyte maturation. But according to the IH, there are not significant differences between both mature males and females despite females needing to store great amounts of lipids in their livers during previtellogenic and gestation phases. This is consistent with mature females of the Aleutian skate Bathyraja aleutica (Gilbert 1896) reported by Ebert (2005). Mabragaña et al. (2002) and Oddone & Velasco (2006) described similar observa- tions in the smallnose fanskate Sympterygia bonapartii Müller & Henle 1841 and the eyespot skate Atlantoraja cyclophora (Regan 1903) from the south-west Atlantic ocean. While many elasmobranchs have a single functional ovary (Dodd et al. 1983; Hamlett & Koob, 1999; Musick & Ellis, 2005), ovarian symmetry, as observed in Z. chilensis, is common in all skates (Oddone et al., 2007). The symmetry of paired structures extended to other part of the reproductive system, which is also consistent with previous studies on skates that have shown no difference between oocyte number and oviducal-gland width (Mabragaña et al. 2002; Ebert 2005; Ebert et al. 2008). While male maturity occurred at c. 88 cm LT, however, the relationship between LC and LT during the maturation phase suggested that there was an unusually high degree of plasticity in the size at maturity compared to other skates (Ebert, 2005). Despite relatively large geographical differences between sampling locations, the results from the present study provide similar estimates of sexual maturity to those made previously in the south-western Pacific Ocean (Licandeo et al., 2006) and the south-western Atlantic Ocean (Oddone et al., 2005; Paesch & Oddone, 2008), suggesting that size at maturity is a conservative trait in this species as a compen- satory dynamic over latitudinal gradients in the entire fishery and occurrences zones (Frisk, 2010). Large batoids appear to be longer-lived, slower growing and have lower repro- ductive output among the elasmobranchs, which makes them highly susceptible to overexploitation (Dulvy et al., 2000). Besides, fisheries may change abundance and distribution of skates as most of these fisheries are biased towards larger individuals (Jennings et al., 1999; Frisk, 2010). Indeed, there is a negative correlation between skate body size and population trend (Walker & Hislop, 1998; Dulvy et al., 2000), and Z. chilensis is no exception. According to Licandeo et al. (2006), the main tar- gets of the Z. chilensis fishery in Chile are immature fish.

B U S TA M A N T E E T A L . that 106 cm LT females (c. 14 years-old) and 86 cm LT males (c. 11 years-old) rep- resent 85% of total catch and, as small Z. chilensis (<35 cm LT) are discarded, there is evidence of a fishery highly biased towards mid-sized Z. chilensis that may compromise the stock integrity. Reproductive seasonality could not be determined given the scarcity of gravid females and the limited number of months sampled by this fishery. The monthly mean maximum ovarian-follicle diameter and IH did not, however, differ significantly across the 4 month study period which is consistent with the suggestion that deep- water skate species may not exhibit a defined reproductive or egg-laying season (Braccini & Chiaramonte, 2002; Mabragaña et al., 2002; Ruocco et al., 2006; Ebert et al., 2008). It should be noted though that the data in the current study would also be consistent with a defined reproductive season that coincided with the sampling period, and further studies of this species across all months of the year are necessary to resolve the issue. Fishing records of Z. chilensis in the southern Falkland Islands demonstrated that an intense fishing operation culminated in a drastic stock collapse (Agnew et al., 2000). The present results indicate that 89% of the females captured were below size at maturity, which may pose a serious threat to their population. The size structure of the Z. chilensis catch in the Valdivia fishing zone (39·4◦ S to 40·5◦ S) differs considerably when compared to the reported catch from fishing grounds to the south: around Chiloé Island (41·5◦ S to 43·5◦ S), Moraleda Channel (43·8◦ S to 45·9◦ S) and Castro-Magallanes Channel (51·0◦ S to 54·0◦ S) (Quiroz et al., 2009).

This pattern is repeated for males, with mature individuals comprising c. 75% of the catch in the Castro-Magallanes Channel zone compared with c. 14% in the Valdivia zone [Fig. 7(b)]. Evidence of an increasing median LT (LT of 50% of the catch) with respect to latitude can be observed in both sexes even though the same fishing gear is used in all zones. The reason for these differences in catch size structure may be the result of fishing effort moving south as the southernmost fishing grounds have been developed relatively recently compared to the Valdivia zone (Quiroz et al., 2011). If the southern fishery catch composition represents a relatively natural situation, then the catch size structure in the northern fisheries suggests that they are at particular risk of collapse if the tonnage landed is maintained, as mature Z. chilensis numbers appear to have been overfished. Growth rates and recruitment need to be evaluated in each fishery zone for a better understanding of the population ecology and dynamics of Z. chilensis in southern Chile. If the intrinsic vulnerability and long life spans of Z. chilensis are considered, the implications for survival and the signs of an imminent fishery collapse need to be reviewed by management authorities before local extirpation occurs, such as have been documented for other species of skates by Dulvy & Forrest (2010).
