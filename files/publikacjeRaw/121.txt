untitled CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants: 2010* Peter J. Mohr, † Barry N. Taylor, ‡ and David B. Newell § National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899-8420, USA (published 13 November 2012) This paper gives the 2010 self-consistent set of values of the basic constants and conversion factors of physics and chemistry recommended by the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) for international use. The 2010 adjustment takes into account the data considered in the 2006 adjustment as well as the data that became available from 1 January 2007, after the closing date of that adjustment, until 31 December 2010, the closing date of the new adjustment. Further, it describes in detail the adjustment of the values of the constants, including the selection of the final set of input data based on the results of least-squares analyses. The 2010 set replaces the previously recommended 2006 CODATA set and may also be found on the World Wide Web at physics.nist.gov/constants.

Background This article reports work carried out under the auspices of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) Task Group on Fundamental Constants. 1 It de- scribes in detail the CODATA 2010 least-squares adjustment of the values of the constants, for which the closing date for new data was 31 December 2010. Equally important, it gives the 2010 self-consistent set of over 300 CODATA recom- mended values of the fundamental physical constants based on the 2010 adjustment. The 2010 set, which replaces its immediate predecessor resulting from the CODATA 2006 adjustment (Mohr, Taylor, and Newell, 2008), first became available on 2 June 2011 at physics.nist.gov/constants, a Web site of the NIST Fundamental Constants Data Center (FCDC). The World Wide Web has engendered a sea change in expectations regarding the availability of timely information. Further, in recent years new data that influence our knowl- edge of the values of the constants seem to appear almost continuously. As a consequence, the Task Group decided at the time of the 1998 CODATA adjustment to take advantage of the extensive computerization that had been incorporated in that effort to issue a new set of recommended values every 4 years; in the era of the Web, the 12–13 years between the first CODATA set of 1973 (Cohen and Taylor, 1973) and the 1 CODATA was established in 1966 as an interdisciplinary com- mittee of the International Council for Science. The Task Group was founded 3 years later. 1528 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 second CODATA set of 1986 (Cohen and Taylor, 1987), and between this second set and the third set of 1998 (Mohr and Taylor, 2000), could no longer be tolerated. Thus, if the 1998 set is counted as the first of the new 4-year cycle, the 2010 set is the 4th of that cycle. Throughout this article we refer to the detailed reports describing the 1998, 2002, and 2006 adjustments as CODATA-98, CODATA-02, and CODATA-06, respectively (Mohr and Taylor, 2000, 2005; Mohr, Taylor, and Newell, 2008). To keep the paper to a reasonable length, our data review focuses on the new results that became available between the 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2010 clos- ing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjustments; the reader should consult these past reports for detailed discussions of the older data. These past reports should also be consulted for discus- sions of motivation, philosophy, the treatment of numerical calculations and uncertainties, etc. A rather complete list of acronyms and symbols can be found in the list of symbols and abbreviations near the end of the paper. To further achieve a reduction in the length of this report compared to the lengths of its three most recent predecessors, it has been decided to omit extensive descriptions of new experiments and calculations and to comment only on their most pertinent features; the original references should be consulted for details. For the same reason, sometimes the older data used in the 2010 adjustment are not given in the portion of the paper that discusses the data by category, but are given in the portion of the paper devoted to data analysis. For example, the actual values of the 16 older items of input data recalled in Sec. VIII are given only in Sec. XIII, rather than in both sections as done in previous adjustment reports. As in all previous CODATA adjustments, as a working principle, the validity of the physical theory underlying the 2010 adjustment is assumed. This includes special relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics (QED), the standard model of particle physics, including CPT invari- ance, and the exactness (for all practical purposes, see Sec. VIII) of the relationships between the Josephson and von Klitzing constants KJ and RK and the elementary charge e and Planck constant h, namely, KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2. Although the possible time variation of the constants con- tinues to be an active field of both experimental and theoreti- cal research, there is no observed variation relevant to the data on which the 2010 recommended values are based; see, for example, the recent reviews by Chiba (2011) and Uzan (2011). Other references can be found in the FCDC biblio- graphic database at physics.nist.gov/constantsbib using, for example, the keywords ‘‘time variation’’ or ‘‘constants.’’ With regard to the 31 December closing date for new data, a datum was considered to have met this date if the Task Group received a preprint describing the work by that date and the preprint had already been, or shortly would be, submitted for publication. Although results are identified by the year in which they were published in an archival journal, it can be safely assumed that any input datum labeled with an ‘‘11’’ or ‘‘12’’ identifier was in fact available by the closing date. However, the 31 December 2010 closing date does not apply to clarifying information requested from authors; in- deed, such information was received up to shortly before 2 June 2011, the date the new values were posted on the FCDC Web site. This is the reason that some private commu- nications have 2011 dates. B. Brief overview of CODATA 2010 adjustment The 2010 set of recommended values is the result of applying the same procedures as in previous adjustments and is based on a least-squares adjustment with, in this case, N ¼ 160 items of input data, M ¼ 83 variables called adjusted constants, and � ¼ N �M ¼ 77 degrees of free- dom. The statistic ‘‘chi squared’’ is �2 ¼ 59:1 with proba- bility pð�2j�Þ ¼ 0:94 and Birge ratio RB ¼ 0:88. A significant number of new results became available for consideration, both experimental and theoretical, from 1 January 2007, after the closing date of the 2006 adjustment, to 31 December 2010, the closing date of the current adjust- ment. Data that affect the determination of the fine-structure constant �, Planck constant h, molar gas constant R, Newtonian constant of gravitation G, Rydberg constant R1, and rms proton charge radius rp are the focus of this brief overview, because of their inherent importance and, in the case of �, h, and R, their impact on the determination of the values of many other constants. (Constants that are not among the directly adjusted constants are calculated from appropri- ate combinations of those that are directly adjusted.) 1. Fine-structure constant � An improved measurement of the electron magnetic- moment anomaly ae, the discovery and correction of an error in its theoretical expression, and an improved measurement of the quotient h=mð87RbÞ have led to a 2010 value of � with a relative standard uncertainty of 3:2� 10�10 compared to 6:8� 10�10 for the 2006 value. Of more significance, because of the correction of the error in the theory, the 2010 value of � shifted significantly and now is larger than the 2006 value by 6.5 times the uncertainty of that value. This change has rather profound consequences, becausemany constants depend on�, for example, the molar Planck constant NAh. 2. Planck constant h A new value of the Avogadro constant NA with a relative uncertainty of 3:0� 10�8 obtained from highly enriched silicon with amount of substance fraction xð28SiÞ � 0:999 96 replaces the 2006 value based on natural silicon and provides an inferred value of h with essentially the same uncertainty. This uncertainty is somewhat smaller than 3:6� 10�8, the uncertainty of the most accurate directly measured watt-balance value of h. Because the two values disagree, the uncertainties used for them in the adjustment were increased by a factor of 2 to reduce the inconsistency to an acceptable level; hence the relative uncertainties of the recommended values of h and NA are 4:4� 10�8, only slightly smaller than the uncertainties of the corresponding 2006 values. The 2010 value of h is larger than the 2006 value by the fractional amount 9:2� 10�8 while the 2010 value of NA is smaller than the 2006 value by the fractional amount 8:3� 10�8. A number of other constants depend on h, for example, the first radiation constant c1, and consequently the 2010 recom- mended values of these constants reflect the change in h. Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1529 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 3. Molar gas constant R Four consistent new values of the molar gas constant together with the two previous consistent values, with which the new values also agree, have led to a new 2010 recom- mended value of R with an uncertainty of 9:1� 10�7 com- pared to 1:7� 10�6 for the 2006 value. The 2010 value is smaller than the 2006 value by the fractional amount 1:2� 10�6 and the relative uncertainty of the 2010 value is a little over half that of the 2006 value. This shift and uncertainty reduction is reflected in a number of constants that depend on R, for example, the Boltzmann constant k and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant �. 4. Newtonian constant of gravitation G Two new values of G resulting from two new experiments each with comparatively small uncertainties but in disagree- ment with each other and with earlier measurements with comparable uncertainties led to an even larger expansion of the a priori assigned uncertainties of the data for G than was used in 2006. In both cases the expansion reduced the incon- sistencies to an acceptable level. This increase has resulted in a 20% increase in uncertainty of the 2010 recommended value compared to that of the 2006 value: 12 parts in 105 vs 10 parts in 105. Furthermore, the 2010 recommended value of G is smaller than the 2006 value by the fractional amount 6:6� 10�5. 5. Rydberg constant R1 and proton radius rp New experimental and theoretical results that have become available in the past 4 years have led to the reduction in the relative uncertainty of the recommended value of the Rydberg constant from 6:6� 10�12 to 5:0� 10�12, and the reduction in uncertainty of the proton rms charge radius from 0.0069 fm to 0.0051 fm based on spectroscopic and scattering data but not muonic hydrogen data. Data from muonic hydro- gen, with the assumption that the muon and electron interact with the proton at short distances in exactly the same way, are so inconsistent with the other data that they have not been included in the determination of rp and thus do not have an influence on R1. The 2010 value of R1 exceeds the 2006 value by the fractional amount 1:1� 10�12 and the 2010 value of rp exceeds the 2006 value by 0.0007 fm. C. Outline of the paper Section II briefly recalls some constants that have exact values in the International System of Units (SI) (BIPM, 2006), the unit system used in all CODATA adjustments. Sections III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII discuss the input data with a strong focus on those results that became available between the 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2010 closing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjust- ments. It should be recalled (see especially Appendix E of CODATA-98) that in a least-squares analysis of the constants, both the experimental and theoretical numerical data, also called observational data or input data, are expressed as functions of a set of independent variables called directly adjusted constants (or sometimes simply adjusted constants). The functions themselves are called observational equations, and the least-squares procedure provides best estimates, in the least-squares sense, of the adjusted constants. In essence, the procedure determines the best estimate of a particular adjusted constant by automatically taking into account all possible ways of determining its value from the input data. The rec- ommended values of those constants not directly adjusted are calculated from the adjusted constants. Section XIII describes the analysis of the data. The analysis includes comparison of measured values of the same quantity, measured values of different quantities through inferred val- ues of another quantity such as � or h, and by the method of least squares. The final input data used to determine the adjusted constants, and hence the entire 2010 CODATA set of recommended values, are based on these investigations. Section XIV provides, in several tables, the set of over 300 recommended values of the basic constants and conversion factors of physics and chemistry, including the covariance matrix of a selected group of constants. Section XV con- cludes the report with a comparison of a small representative subset of 2010 recommended values with their 2006 counter- parts, comments on some of the more important implications of the 2010 adjustment for metrology and physics, and suggestions for future experimental and theoretical work that will improve our knowledge of the values of the con- stants. Also touched upon is the potential importance of this work and that of the next CODATA constants adjustment (expected 31 December 2014 closing date) for the redefini- tion of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole currently under discussion internationally (Mills et al., 2011). II. SPECIAL QUANTITIES AND UNITS As a consequence of the SI definitions of the meter, the ampere, and the mole, c, �0, and �0, and Mð12CÞ and Mu, have exact values; see Table I. Since the relative atomic mass ArðXÞ of an entity X is defined by ArðXÞ ¼ mðXÞ=mu, where TABLE I. Some exact quantities relevant to the 2010 adjustment.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 mðXÞ is the mass of X, and the (unified) atomic mass constant mu is defined according to mu ¼ mð12CÞ=12, Arð12CÞ ¼ 12 exactly, as shown in the table. Since the number of specified entities in 1 mol is equal to the numerical value of the Avogadro constant NA � 6:022� 1023=mol, it follows that the molar mass of an entity X, MðXÞ, is given by MðXÞ ¼ NAmðXÞ ¼ ArðXÞMu and Mu ¼ NAmu. The (unified) atomic mass unit u (also called the dalton, Da) is defined as 1 u ¼ mu � 1:66� 10�27 kg. The last two entries in Table I, KJ�90 and RK�90, are the conventional values of the Josephson and von Klitzing constants introduced on 1 January 1990 by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) to foster worldwide uniformity in the measurement of elec- trical quantities. In this paper, those electrical quantities measured in terms of the Josephson and quantum Hall effects with the assumption that KJ and RK have these conventional values are labeled with a subscript 90. Measurements of the quantity K2JRK¼4=h using a moving coil watt balance (see Sec. VIII) require the determination of the local acceleration of free fallg at the site of the balancewith a relative uncertainty of a few parts in 109. That currently available absolute gravimeters can achieve such an uncertainty if properly used has been demonstrated by comparing different instruments at essentially the same location. An important example is the periodic international comparison of absolute gravimeters (ICAG) carried out at the International Bureau ofWeights andMeasures (BIPM), Sèvres, France (Jiang et al., 2011). The good agreement obtained between a commercial optical interferometer-based gravimeter that is in wide use and a cold atom, atomic interferometer-based instrument also provides evidence that the claimed uncertainties of determinations of g are realistic (Merlet et al., 2010). However, not all gravimeter comparisons have obtained such satisfactory results (Louchet-Chauvet et al., 2011). Additional work in this area may be needed when the relative uncer- tainties of watt-balance experiments reach the level of 1 part in 108. III. RELATIVE ATOMIC MASSES The directly adjusted constants include the relative atomic masses ArðXÞ of a number of particles, atoms, and ions. Further, values of ArðXÞ of various atoms enter the calcula- tions of several potential input data. The following sections and Tables II, III, and IV summarize the relevant information. A. Relative atomic masses of atoms Table II, which is identical to Table II in CODATA-06, gives values of ArðXÞ taken from the 2003 atomic mass evaluation (AME2003) carried out by the Atomic Mass Data Center (AMDC), Centre de Spectrométrie Nucléaire et de Spectrométrie de Masse, Orsay, France (Audi, Wapstra, and Thibault, 2003; Wapstra, Audi, and Thibault, 2003; AMDC, 2006). However, not all of these values are actually used in the adjustment; some are given for comparison pur- poses only. Although these values are correlated to a certain extent, the only correlation that needs to be taken into account in the current adjustment is that between Arð1HÞ and Arð2HÞ; their correlation coefficient is 0.0735 (AMDC, 2003). Table III lists seven values of ArðXÞ relevant to the 2010 adjustment obtained since the publication of AME2003. It is the updated version of Table IV in CODATA-06. The changes made are the deletion of the 3H and 3He values obtained by the SMILETRAP group at Stockholm University (StockU), Sweden; and the inclusion of values for 28Si, 87Rb, and 133Cs obtained by the group at Florida State University (FSU), Tallahassee, FL, USA (Redshaw, McDaniel, and Myers, 2008; Mount, Redshaw, and Myers, 2010). This group uses the method initially developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA (Rainville et al., 2005). In the MIT approach, which eliminates or TABLE II.

[The value of Arð29SiÞ in Table III is given in the supplementary information of the last cited reference.] The deleted SMILETRAP results are not discarded but are included in the adjustment in a more fundamental way, as described in Sec. III.C. The values of Arð2HÞ, Arð4HeÞ, and Arð16OÞ in Table III were obtained by the University of Washington (UWash) group, Seattle, WA, USA, and were used in the 2006 adjustment. The three values are correlated and their variances, covariances, and correlation coefficients are given in Table IV, which is identical to Table VI in CODATA-06. The values of ArðXÞ from Table II initially used as input data for the 2010 adjustment are Arð1HÞ, Arð2HÞ, Arð87RbÞ, and Arð133CsÞ; and from Table III, Arð2HÞ, Arð4HeÞ, Arð16OÞ, Arð87RbÞ, and Arð133CsÞ. These values are items B1, B2:1, B2:2, and B7–B10:2 in Table XX, Sec. XIII. As in the 2006 adjustment, the AME2003 values for Arð3HÞ, and Arð3HeÞ in Table II are not used because they were influenced by an earlier 3He result of the UWash group that disagrees with their newer, more accurate result (Van Dyck, 2010). Although not yet published, it can be said that it agrees well with the value from the SMILETRAP group; see Sec. III.C. Also as in the 2006 adjustment, the UWash group’s values for Arð4HeÞ and Arð16OÞ in Table III are used in place of the corresponding AME2003 values in Table II because the latter are based on a preliminary analysis of the data while those in Table III are based on a thorough reanalysis of the data (Van Dyck, et al., 2006). Finally, we note that the Arð2HÞ value of the UWash group in Table III is the same as used in the 2006 adjustment. As discussed in CODATA-06, it is a near-final result with a conservatively assigned uncertainty based on the analysis of 10 runs taken over a 4-year period privately communicated to the Task Group in 2006 by R. S. Van Dyck. A final result completely consistent with it based on the analysis of 11 runs but with an uncertainty of about half that given in the table should be published in due course together with the final result for Arð3HeÞ (Van Dyck, 2010). B. Relative atomic masses of ions and nuclei For a neutral atom X, ArðXÞ can be expressed in terms of Ar of an ion of the atom formed by the removal of n electrons according to ArðXÞ ¼ ArðXnþÞ þ nArðeÞ � EbðXÞ � EbðXnþÞ muc 2 : (1) In this expression, EbðXÞ=muc2 is the relative-atomic-mass equivalent of the total binding energy of the Z electrons of the atom and Z is the atom’s atomic number (proton number). Similarly, EbðXnþÞ=muc2 is the relative-atomic-mass equiva- lent of the binding energy of the Z� n electrons of the Xnþ ion. For an ion that is fully stripped n ¼ Z and XZþ is simply N, the nucleus of the atom. In this case EbðXZþÞ=muc2 ¼ 0 and Eq. (1) becomes of the form of the first two equations of Table XXXIII, Sec. XIII. The binding energies Eb employed in the 2010 adjustment are the same as those used in that of 2002 and 2006; see Table IV of CODATA-02. However, the binding energy for tritium, 3H, is not included in that table. We employ the value used in the 2006 adjustment, 1:097 185 439� 107 m�1, due to Kotochigova (2006). For our purposes here, the uncertain- ties of the binding energies are negligible. C. Relative atomic masses of the proton, triton, and helion The focus of this section is the cyclotron frequency ratio measurements of the SMILETRAP group that lead to values of ArðpÞ, ArðtÞ, and ArðhÞ, where the triton t and helion h are the nuclei of 3H and 3He. The reported values of Nagy et al. (2006) for Arð3HÞ and Arð3HeÞ were used as input data in the 2006 adjustment but are not used in this adjustment. Instead, the actual cyclotron frequency ratio results underlying those values are used as input data. This more fundamental way of handling the SMILETRAP group’s results is motivated by the similar but more recent work of the group related to the proton, which we discuss before considering the earlier work. Solders et al. (2008) used the Penning-trap mass spec- trometer SMILETRAP, described in detail by Bergström et al. (2002), to measure the ratio of the cyclotron frequency fc of the H2 þ� molecular ion to that of the deuteron d, the nucleus of the 2H atom. (The cyclotron frequency of an ion of charge q and mass m in a magnetic flux density B is given by fc ¼ qB=2�m.) Here the asterisk indicates that the singly ionized H2 molecules are in excited vibrational states as a result of the 3.4 keV electrons used to bombard neutral H2 molecules in their vibrational ground state in order to ionize them. The reported result is fcðHþ�2 Þ fcðdÞ ¼0:99923165933ð17Þ ½1:7�10�10�: (2) This value was obtained using a two-pulse Ramsey tech- nique to excite the cyclotron frequencies, thereby enabling a more precise determination of the cyclotron resonance fre- quency line center than was possible with the one-pulse excitation used in earlier work (George et al., 2007; Suhonen et al., 2007). The uncertainty is essentially all statistical; components of uncertainty from systematic effects such as ‘‘q=A asymmetry’’ (difference of charge-to-mass ratio of the two ions), time variation of the 4.7 T applied magnetic flux density, relativistic mass increase, and ion-ion interactions were deemed negligible by comparison. The frequency ratio fcðH2þ�Þ=fcðdÞ can be expressed in terms of adjusted constants and ionization and binding energies that have negligible uncertainties in this context. Based on Sec. III.B we can write ArðH2Þ ¼ 2ArðHÞ � EBðH2Þ=muc2; (3) ArðHÞ ¼ ArðpÞ þ ArðeÞ � EIðHÞ=muc2; (4) ArðH2Þ ¼ ArðHþ2 Þ þ ArðeÞ � EIðH2Þ=muc2; (5) ArðHþ�2 Þ ¼ ArðHþ2 Þ þ Eav=muc2; (6) which yields 1532 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 ArðHþ�2 Þ ¼ 2ArðpÞ þ ArðeÞ � EBðHþ�2 Þ=muc2; (7) where EBðHþ�2 Þ ¼ 2EIðHÞ þ EBðH2Þ � EIðH2Þ � Eav (8) is the binding energy of the Hþ�2 excited molecule. Here EIðHÞ is the ionization energy of hydrogen, EBðH2Þ is the disassociation energy of the H2 molecule, EIðH2Þ is the single electron ionization energy of H2, and Eav is the average vibrational excitation energy of an Hþ2 molecule as a result of the ionization of H2 by 3.4 keV electron impact. The observational equation for the frequency ratio is thus fcðHþ�2 Þ fcðdÞ ¼ ArðdÞ 2ArðpÞ þ ArðeÞ � EBðHþ�2 Þ=muc2 : (9) We treat Eav as an adjusted constant in addition to ArðeÞ, ArðpÞ, and ArðdÞ in order to take its uncertainty into account in a consistent way, especially since it enters into the observa- tional equations for the frequency ratios to be discussed below. The required ionization and binding energies as well as Eav that we use are as given by Solders et al. (2008) and except for Eav, have negligible uncertainties: EIðHÞ ¼ 13:5984 eV ¼ 14:5985� 10�9muc2; (10) EBðH2Þ ¼ 4:4781 eV ¼ 4:8074� 10�9muc2; (11) EIðH2Þ ¼ 15:4258 eV ¼ 16:5602� 10�9muc2; (12) Eav ¼ 0:740ð74Þ eV ¼ 0:794ð79Þ � 10�9muc2: (13) We now consider the SMILETRAP results of Nagy et al. (2006) for the ratio of the cyclotron frequency of the triton t and of the 3Heþ ion to that of the H2 þ� molecular ion. They report for the triton fcðtÞ fcðHþ�2 Þ ¼0:66824772686ð55Þ ½8:2�10�10� (14) and for the 3Heþ ion fcð3HeþÞ fcðHþ�2 Þ ¼0:66825214682ð55Þ ½8:2�10�10�: (15) The relative uncertainty of the triton ratio consists of the following uncertainty components in parts in 109: 0:22 sta- tistical, and 0.1, 0.1, 0.77, and 0.1 due to relativistic mass shift, ion number dependence, q=A asymmetry, and contami- nant ions, respectively. The components for the 3Heþ ion ratio are the same except the statistical uncertainty is 0.24. All of these components are independent except the 0:77� 10�9 component due to q=A asymmetry; it leads to a correlation coefficient between the two frequency ratios of 0.876. Observational equations for these frequency ratios are fcðtÞ fcðHþ�2 Þ ¼ 2ArðpÞ þ ArðeÞ � EBðH þ� 2 Þ=muc2 ArðtÞ (16) and fcð3HeþÞ fcðHþ�2 Þ ¼ 2ArðpÞ þ ArðeÞ � EBðH þ� 2 Þ=muc2 ArðhÞ þ ArðeÞ � EIð3HeþÞ=muc2 ; (17) where Arð3HeþÞ ¼ ArðhÞ þ ArðeÞ � EIð3HeþÞ=muc2 (18) and EIð3HeþÞ ¼ 51:4153 eV ¼ 58:4173� 10�9muc2 (19) is the ionization energy of the 3Heþ ion, based on Table IVof CODATA-02. The energy Eav and the three frequency ratios given in Eqs. (2), (14), and (15), are items B3 to B6 in Table XX. D. Cyclotron resonance measurement of the electron relative atomic mass As in the 2002 and 2006 CODATA adjustments, we take as an input datum the Penning-trap result for the electron relative atomic mass ArðeÞ obtained by the University of Washington group (Farnham, Van Dyck, Jr., and Schwinberg, 1995): ArðeÞ¼0:000 548 579 9111ð12Þ ½2:1�10�9�: (20) This is item B11 of Table XX. IV. ATOMIC TRANSITION FREQUENCIES Measurements and theory of transition frequencies in hy- drogen, deuterium, antiprotonic helium, and muonic hydro- gen provide information on the Rydberg constant, the proton and deuteron charge radii, and the relative atomic mass of the electron. These topics as well as hyperfine and fine-structure splittings are considered in this section. A. Hydrogen and deuterium transition frequencies, the Rydberg constant R1, and the proton and deuteron charge radii rp, rd Transition frequencies between states a and b in hydrogen and deuterium are given by �ab ¼ Eb � Ea h ; (21) where Ea and Eb are the energy levels of the states. The energy levels divided by h are given by Ea h ¼ �� 2mec 2 2n2ah ð1þ �aÞ ¼ � R1c n2a ð1þ �aÞ; (22) where R1c is the Rydberg constant in frequency units, na is the principle quantum number of state a, and �a is a small correction factor (j�aj � 1) that contains the details of the theory of the energy level, including the effect of the finite size of the nucleus as a function of the rms charge radius rp for hydrogen or rd for deuterium. In the following summary, corrections are given in terms of the contribution to the energy level, but in the numerical evaluation for the least- squares adjustment, R1 is factored out of the expressions and is an adjusted constant.

Theory of hydrogen and deuterium energy levels Here we provide the information necessary to determine theoretical values of the relevant energy levels, with the emphasis of the discussion on results that have become avail- able since the 2006 adjustment. For brevity, most references to earlier work, which can be found in Eides, Grotch, and Shelyuto (2001b, 2007), for example, are not included here. Theoretical values of the energy levels of different states are highly correlated. In particular, uncalculated terms for S states are primarily of the form of an unknown common constant divided by n3. We take this fact into account by calculating covariances between energy levels in addition to the uncertainties of the individual levels (see Sec. IV.A.1.l). The correlated uncertainties are denoted by u0, while the uncorrelated uncertainties are denoted by un. a. Dirac eigenvalue The Dirac eigenvalue for an electron in a Coulomb field is ED ¼ fðn; jÞmec2; (23) where fðn; jÞ ¼ � 1þ ðZ�Þ 2 ðn� �Þ2 ��1=2 ; (24) n and j are the principal quantum number and total angular momentum of the state, respectively, and � ¼ jþ 1 2 � �� jþ 1 2 � 2 � ðZ�Þ2 � 1=2 : (25) In Eqs. (24) and (25), Z is the charge number of the nucleus, which for hydrogen and deuterium is 1. However, we shall retain Z as a parameter to classify the various contributions. Equation (23) is valid only for an infinitely heavy nucleus. For a nucleus with a finite mass mN that expression is replaced by (Barker and Glover, 1955; Sapirstein and Yennie, 1990): EMðHÞ ¼Mc2 þ ½fðn; jÞ � 1�mrc2 � ½fðn; jÞ � 1�2 m2r c 2 2M þ 1��‘0 �ð2‘þ 1Þ ðZ�Þ4m3r c2 2n3m2N þ �� � (26) for hydrogen or by (Pachucki and Karshenboim, 1995) EMðDÞ ¼Mc2 þ ½fðn; jÞ � 1�mrc2 � ½fðn; jÞ � 1�2 m2r c 2 2M þ 1 �ð2‘þ 1Þ ðZ�Þ4m3r c2 2n3m2N þ �� � (27) for deuterium. In Eqs. (26) and (27) ‘ is the nonrelativistic orbital angular momentum quantum number, � ¼ ð�1Þj�‘þ1=2ðjþ 1 2 Þ is the angular-momentum-parity quantum number, M ¼ me þmN, and mr ¼ memN=ðme þmNÞ is the reduced mass. Equations (26) and (27) differ in that the Darwin-Foldy term proportional to �‘0 is absent in Eq. (27), because it does not occur for a spin-one nucleus such as the deuteron (Pachucki and Karshenboim, 1995). In the three previous adjustments, Eq. (26) was used for both hydrogen and deu- terium and the absence of the Darwin-Foldy term in the case of deuterium was accounted for by defining an effective deuteron radius given by Eq. (A56) of CODATA-98 and using it to calculate the finite nuclear-size correction given by Eq. (A43) and the related equations in that paper. The extra term in the size correction canceled the Darwin-Foldy term in Eq. (26); see also Sec. IV.A.1.h. b. Relativistic recoil The leading relativistic-recoil correction, to lowest order in Z� and all orders in me=mN, is (Erickson, 1977; Sapirstein and Yennie, 1990) ES ¼ m3r m2emN ðZ�Þ5 �n3 mec 2 � 1 3 �‘0 lnðZ�Þ�2 � 8 3 lnk0ðn; ‘Þ � 1 9 �‘0 � 7 3 an � 2 m2N �m2e �‘0 � m2N ln � me mr � �m2e ln � mN mr ��� ; (28) where an ¼ �2 � ln � 2 n � þ Xn i¼1 1 i þ 1� 1 2n � �‘0 þ 1� �‘0 ‘ð‘þ 1Þð2‘þ 1Þ : (29) To lowest order in the mass ratio, the next two orders in Z� are ER ¼ me mN ðZ�Þ6 n3 mec 2½D60 þD72Z�ln2ðZ�Þ�2 þ � � ��; (30) where for nS1=2 states (Pachucki and Grotch, 1995; Eides and Grotch, 1997c; Melnikov and Yelkhovsky, 1999; Pachucki and Karshenboim, 1999) D60 ¼ 4 ln2� 7 2 ; (31) D72 ¼ � 11 60� ; (32) and for states with ‘ � 1 (Golosov et al., 1995; Elkhovski��, 1996; Jentschura and Pachucki, 1996) D60 ¼ � 3� ‘ð‘þ 1Þ n2 � 2 ð4‘2 � 1Þð2‘þ 3Þ : (33) Based on the general pattern of the magnitudes of higher- order coefficients, the uncertainty for S states is taken to be 10% of Eq. (30), and for states with ‘ � 1, it is taken to be 1%. Numerical values for Eq. (30) to all orders in Z� have been obtained by Shabaev et al. (1998), and although they disagree somewhat with the analytic result, they are consis- tent within the uncertainty assigned here. We employ the analytic equations in the adjustment. The covariances of the theoretical values are calculated by assuming that the uncer- tainties are predominately due to uncalculated terms propor- tional to ðme=mNÞ=n3. 1534 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 c. Nuclear polarizability For hydrogen, we use the result (Khriplovich and Sen’kov, 2000) EPðHÞ ¼ �0:070ð13Þh �l0 n3 kHz: (34) More recent results are a model calculation by Nevado and Pineda (2008) and a slightly different result than Eq. (34) calculated by Martynenko (2006). For deuterium, the sum of the proton polarizability, the neutron polarizibility (Khriplovich and Sen’kov, 1998), and the dominant nuclear structure polarizibility (Friar and Payne, 1997a), gives EPðDÞ ¼ �21:37ð8Þh �l0 n3 kHz: (35) Presumably the polarization effect is negligible for states of higher ‘ in either hydrogen or deuterium. d. Self energy The one-photon self energy of the bound electron is E ð2Þ SE ¼ � � ðZ�Þ4 n3 FðZ�Þmec2; (36) where FðZ�Þ ¼ A41 lnðZ�Þ�2 þ A40 þ A50ðZ�Þ þ A62ðZ�Þ2ln2ðZ�Þ�2 þ A61ðZ�Þ2 lnðZ�Þ�2 þGSEðZ�ÞðZ�Þ2: (37) From Erickson and Yennie (1965) and earlier papers cited therein, A41 ¼ 4 3 �‘0; A40 ¼ � 4 3 lnk0ðn; ‘Þ þ 10 9 �‘0 � 1 2�ð2‘þ 1Þ ð1� �‘0Þ; A50 ¼ � 139 32 � 2 ln2 � ��‘0; A62 ¼ ��‘0; A61 ¼ � 4 � 1þ 1 2 þ � � � þ 1 n � þ 28 3 ln2� 4 ln n� 601 180 � 77 45n2 � �‘0 þ � 1� 1 n2 �� 2 15 þ 1 3 �j 1 2 � �‘1 þ ½96n 2 � 32‘ð‘þ 1Þ�ð1� �‘0Þ 3n2ð2‘� 1Þð2‘Þð2‘þ 1Þð2‘þ 2Þð2‘þ 3Þ : (38) The Bethe logarithms lnk0ðn; ‘Þ in Eq. (38) are given in Table V (Drake and Swainson, 1990). For S and P states with n 4, the values we use here for GSEðZ�Þ in Eq. (37) are listed in Table VI and are based on direct numerical evaluations by Jentschura, Mohr, and Soff (1999, 2001) and Jentschura and Mohr (2004, 2005). The values of GSEð�Þ for the 6S and 8S states are based on the low-Z limit GSEð0Þ ¼ A60 (Jentschura, Czarnecki, and Pachucki, 2005) together with extrapolations of the results of complete numerical calculations of FðZ�Þ in Eq. (36) at higher Z (Kotochigova, Mohr, and 2006). A calculation of the constant A60 for various D states, including 12D states, has been done by Wundt and Jentschura (2008). In CODATA-06 TABLE V.

The more recent calculated values are A60ð12D3=2Þ ¼ 0:008 909 60ð5Þ; (39) A60ð12D5=2Þ ¼ 0:034 896 67ð5Þ: (40) To estimate the corresponding value of GSEð�Þ, we use the data from Jentschura et al. (2005) given in Table VII. It is evident from the table that GSEð�Þ � A60 � 0:000 22 (41) for the nD3=2 and nD5=2 states for n ¼ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, so we make the approximation GSEð�Þ ¼ A60 þ 0:000 22; (42) with an uncertainty given by 0.000 09 and 0.000 22 for the 12D3=2 and 12D5=2 states, respectively. This yields GSEð�Þ ¼ 0:000 130ð90Þ for 12D3=2; (43) GSEð�Þ ¼ 0:035 12ð22Þ for 12D5=2: (44) All values for GSEð�Þ that we use here are listed in Table VI. The uncertainty of the self-energy contribution to a given level arises entirely from the uncertainty of GSEð�Þ listed in that table and is taken to be type un. The dominant effect of the finite mass of the nucleus on the self-energy correction is taken into account by multiplying each term of FðZ�Þ by the reduced-mass factor ðmr=meÞ3, except that the magnetic-moment term �1=½2�ð2‘þ 1Þ� in A40 is instead multiplied by the factor ðmr=meÞ2. In addition, the argument ðZ�Þ�2 of the logarithms is replaced by ðme=mrÞðZ�Þ�2 (Sapirstein and Yennie, 1990). e.

Values for B61 used in the adjustment are listed in Table IX. For the 1S state, the result of a perturbation theory estimate for the term B60 is (Pachucki, 2001; Pachucki and Jentschura, 2003) B60ð1SÞ ¼ �61:6ð9:2Þ: (62) All-order numerical calculations of the two-photon correction have also been carried out. The diagrams with closed electron loops have been evaluated by Yerokhin, Indelicato, and Shabaev (2008). They obtained results for the 1S, 2S, and 2P states at Z ¼ 1 and higher Z, and obtained a value for the contribution of the terms of order ðZ�Þ6 and higher. The remaining contributions to B60 are from the self-energy dia- grams. These have been evaluated by Yerokhin, Indelicato, and Shabaev (2003, 2005a, 2005b, 2007) for the 1S state for Z ¼ 10 and higher Z, and more recently, Yerokhin (2010) has done an all-order calculation of the 1S-state no-electron-loop two-loop self-energy correction for Z � 10. His extrapolation of the higher-Z values to obtain a value for Z ¼ 1 yields a contribution to B60, including higher-order terms, given by �86ð15Þ. This result combined with the result for the electron-loop two-photon diagrams, reported by Yerokhin, Indelicato, and Shabaev (2008), gives a total of B60 þ � � � ¼ �101ð15Þ, where the dots represent the contribution of the higher-order terms. This may be compared to the earlier evaluation which gave �127ð39Þ (Yerokhin, Indelicato, and Shabaev, 2003, 2005a, 2005b, 2007). The new value also differs somewhat from the result in Eq. (62). In view of this difference between the two calculations, to estimate B60 for the 2010 adjustment, we use the average of the analytic value of B60 and the numerical result for B60 with higher-order terms included, with an uncertainty that is half the difference.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 The higher-order contribution is small compared to the dif- ference between the results of the two methods of calculation. The average result is B60ð1SÞ ¼ �81:3ð0:3Þð19:7Þ: (63) In Eq. (63), the first number in parentheses is the state- dependent uncertainty unðB60Þ associated with the two-loop Bethe logarithm, and the second number in parentheses is the state-independent uncertainty u0ðB60Þ that is common to all S-state values of B60. Two-loop Bethe logarithms needed to evaluate B60ðnSÞ have been given for n ¼ 1 to 6 (Pachucki and Jentschura, 2003; Jentschura, 2004), and a value at n ¼ 8 may be obtained by a simple extrapolation from the calcu- lated values [see Eq. (43) of CODATA-06]. The complete state dependence of B60ðnSÞ in terms of the two-loop Bethe logarithms has been calculated by Czarnecki, Jentschura, and Pachucki (2005) and Jentschura, Czarnecki, and Pachucki (2005). Values of B60 for all relevant S states are given in Table X. For higher-‘ states, an additional consideration is neces- sary. The radiative level shift includes contributions associ- ated with decay to lower levels. At the one-loop level, this is the imaginary part of the level shift corresponding to the resonance scattering width of the level. At the two-loop level there is an imaginary contribution corresponding to two- photon decays and radiative corrections to the one-photon decays, but in addition there is a real contribution from the square of the one-photon decay width. This can be thought of as the second-order term that arises in the expansion of the resonance denominator for scattering of photons from the atom in its ground state in powers of the level width (Jentschura et al., 2002). As such, this term should not be included in the calculation of the resonant line-center shift of the scattering cross section, which is the quantity of interest for the least-squares adjustment. The leading contribution of the square of the one-photon width is of order�ðZ�Þ6mec2=ℏ. This correction vanishes for the 1S and 2S states, because the 1S level has no width and the 2S level can only decay with transition rates that are higher order in � and/or Z�. The higher-n S states have a contribution from the square of the one-photon width from decays to lower P states, but for the 3S and 4S states for which it has been separately identified, this correction is negligible compared to the uncertainty in B60 (Jentschura, 2004, 2006). We assume the correction for higher S states is also negligible compared to the numerical uncer- tainty in B60. However, the correction is taken into account in the 2010 adjustment for P and D states for which it is relatively larger (Jentschura et al., 2002; Jentschura, 2006). Calculations of B60 for higher-‘ states have been made by Jentschura (2006). The results can be expressed as B60ðnLjÞ ¼ aðnLjÞ þ bLðnLÞ; (64) where aðnLjÞ is a precisely calculated term that depends on j, and the two-loop Bethe logarithm bLðnLÞ has a larger nu- merical uncertainty but does not depend on j. Jentschura (2006) gives semianalytic formulas for aðnLjÞ that include numerically calculated terms. The information needed for the 2010 adjustment is in Eqs. (22a), (22b), (23a), and (23b), Tables VII, VIII, IX, and X of Jentschura (2006) and Eq. (17) of Jentschura (2003). Two corrections to Eq. (22b) are � 73 321 103 680 þ 185 1152n þ 8111 25 920n2 ! � 14 405 20 736 þ 185 1152n þ 1579 5184n2 (65) on the first line and � 3187 3600n2 ! þ 3187 3600n2 (66) on the fourth line (Jentschura, 2011a). Values of the two-photon Bethe logarithm bLðnLÞ may be divided into a contribution of the ‘‘squared level width’’ term �2B60 and the rest �bLðnLÞ, so that bLðnLÞ ¼ �2B60 þ �bLðnLÞ: (67) The corresponding value �B60 that represents the shift of the level center is given by �B60ðnLjÞ ¼ aðnLjÞ þ �bLðnLÞ: (68) Here we give the numerical values for �BðnLjÞ in Table X and refer the reader to Jentschura (2006) for the separate values for aðnLjÞ and �bLðnLÞ. The D-state values for n ¼ 6, 8 are extrapolated from the corresponding values at n ¼ 5, 6 with a function of the form aþ b=n. The values in Table X for S states may be regarded as being either B60 or �B60, since the difference is expected to be smaller than the uncertainty. The uncertainties listed for the P- and D-state values of �BðnLjÞ in that table are predominately from the two-photon Bethe logarithm which depends on n and L, but not on j for a given n, L. Therefore there is a large covariance between the corresponding two values of �BðnLjÞ. However, we do not take this into consideration when calculating the uncertainty in the fine-structure splitting, because the uncertainty of higher-order coefficients dominates over any improvement in accuracy the covariance would provide. We assume that the uncertainties in the two-photon Bethe logarithms are suffi- ciently large to account for higher-order P- and D-state two- photon uncertainties as well. For S states, higher-order terms have been estimated by Jentschura, Czarnecki, and Pachucki (2005) with an effective potential model. They find that the next term has a coefficient of B72 and is state independent. We thus assume that the uncertainty u0½B60ðnSÞ� is sufficient to account for the uncer- tainty due to omitting such a term and higher-order state- independent terms. In addition, they find an estimate for the state dependence of the next term, given by �B71ðnSÞ¼B71ðnSÞ�B71ð1SÞ ¼� � 427 36 �16 3 ln2 � � � 3 4 � 1 n þ 1 4n2 þ�þ c ðnÞ� lnn � ; (69) with a relative uncertainty of 50%. We include this additional term, which is listed in Table X, along with the estimated uncertainty unðB71Þ ¼ B71=2. 1538 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B.

Partial re- sults for C50 have been calculated by Eides and Shelyuto (2004, 2007). The uncertainty is taken to be u0ðC50Þ ¼ 30�‘0 and unðC63Þ ¼ 1, where C63 would be the coefficient of ðZ�Þ2ln3ðZ�Þ�2 in the square brackets in Eq. (70). The dominant effect of the finite mass of the nucleus is taken into account by multiplying the term proportional to �‘0 by the reduced-mass factor ðmr=meÞ3 and the term proportional to 1=�ð2‘þ 1Þ, the magnetic-moment term, by the factor ðmr=meÞ2. The contribution from four photons would be of order � � � � 4 ðZ�Þ4 n3 mec 2; (72) which is about 10 Hz for the 1S state and is negligible at the level of uncertainty of current interest. h. Finite nuclear size In the nonrelativistic limit, the level shift due to the finite size of the nucleus is E ð0Þ NS ¼ ENS�‘0; (73) where ENS ¼ 2 3 � mr me � 3 ðZ�Þ2 n3 mec 2 � Z�rN C � 2 ; (74) rN is the bound-state root-mean-square (rms) charge radius of the nucleus, and C is the Compton wavelength of the electron divided by 2�. Higher-order contributions have been examined by Friar (1979b), Friar and Payne (1997b), and Karshenboim (1997) [see also Borisoglebsky and Trofimenko (1979) and Mohr (1983)]. For S states the leading- and next-order corrections are given by ENS ¼ ENS � 1� C� mr me rN C Z�� � ln � mr me rN C Z� n � þ c ðnÞ þ �� ð5nþ 9Þðn� 1Þ 4n2 � C� � ðZ�Þ2 � ; (75) where C� and C� are constants that depend on the charge distribution in the nucleus with values C� ¼ 1:7ð1Þ and C� ¼ 0:47ð4Þ for hydrogen or C� ¼ 2:0ð1Þ and C� ¼ 0:38ð4Þ for deuterium. For the P1=2 states in hydrogen the leading term is ENS ¼ ENS ðZ�Þ2ðn2 � 1Þ 4n2 : (76) For P3=2 states and higher-‘ states the nuclear-size contribu- tion is negligible. As mentioned in Sec. IV.A.1.a, in the 2010 adjustment, we do not use an effective radius for the deuteron, but rather simply rd which is defined by Eq. (74). In CODATA-02, and CODATA-06, the adjustment code used rd as an adjusted variable and that value was reported for the rms radius, rather than the value for Rd defined by Eq. (A56) of CODATA-98, which differs from rd by less than 0.1%. i. Nuclear-size correction to self energy and vacuum polarization There is a correction from the finite size of the nucleus to the self energy (Pachucki, 1993b; Eides and Grotch, 1997b; Milstein, Sushkov, and Terekhov, 2002, 2003b), ENSE ¼ � 4 ln2� 23 4 � �ðZ�ÞENS�‘0; (77) and to the vacuum polarization (Friar, 1979a; Hylton, 1985; Eides and Grotch, 1997b), ENVP ¼ 3 4 �ðZ�ÞENS�‘0: (78) For the self energy, higher-order size corrections have been calculated for S states by Milstein, Sushkov, and Terekhov (2002) and for P states by Jentschura (2003), Milstein, Sushkov, and Terekhov (2003b, 2004). Yerokhin (2011) cal- culated the finite nuclear-size corrections to the self energy and vacuum polarization nonperturbatively inZ� and has extrapo- lated the values for the 1S state to Z ¼ 1. The results are consistent with the higher-order analytic results. Pachucki, in a private communication quoted by Yerokhin (2011), notes that the coefficients of the leading log terms are the same for the nuclear-size correction to the self energy as they are for the self-energy correction to the hyperfine splitting. The latter terms have been calculated by Jentschura and Yerokhin (2010). However, these higher-order terms are negligible at the level of accuracy under consideration. Corrections for higher-‘ states are also expected to be negligible. j. Radiative-recoil corrections Corrections to the self energy and vacuum polarization for the finite mass of the nucleus, beyond the reduced-mass corrections already included, are radiative-recoil effects given by Eides and Grotch (1995b), Pachucki (1995), Melnikov and Yelkhovsky (1999), Pachucki and Karshenboim (1999), Peter J.

(80) for S states. For higher-‘ states, the correction is not included. l. Total energy and uncertainty The energy EXðnLjÞ of a level (where L ¼ S;P; . . . and X ¼ H, D) is the sum of the various contributions listed in the preceding sections plus an additive correction �XðnLjÞ that is zero with an uncertainty that is the rms sum of the uncertain- ties of the individual contributions: u2½�XðnLjÞ� ¼ X i u20iðXLjÞ þ u2niðXLjÞ n6 ; (81) where u0iðXLjÞ=n3 and uniðXLjÞ=n3 are the components of uncertainty u0 and un of contribution i. Uncertainties from the fundamental constants are not explicitly included here, because they are taken into account through the least-squares adjustment. The covariance of any two �’s follows from Eq. (F7) of Appendix F of CODATA-98. For a given isotope u½�Xðn1LjÞ; �Xðn2LjÞ� ¼ X i u20iðXLjÞ ðn1n2Þ3 ; (82) which follows from the fact that uðu0i; uniÞ ¼ 0 and uðun1i; un2iÞ ¼ 0 for n1 � n2. We also assume that u½�Xðn1L1j1 Þ; �Xðn2L2j2Þ� ¼ 0 (83) if L1 � L2 or j1 � j2. For covariances between �’s for hydrogen and deuterium, we have for states of the same n u½�HðnLjÞ;�DðnLjÞ� ¼ X i¼ficg u0iðHLjÞu0iðDLjÞþuniðHLjÞuniðDLjÞ n6 ; (84) and for n1 � n2 u½�Hðn1LjÞ; �Dðn2LjÞ� ¼ X i¼ic u0iðHLjÞu0iðDLjÞ ðn1n2Þ3 ; (85) where the summation is over the uncertainties common to hydrogen and deuterium. We assume u½�Hðn1L1j1Þ; �Dðn2L2j2 Þ� ¼ 0 (86) if L1 � L2 or j1 � j2. The values of u½�XðnLjÞ� of interest for the 2010 adjust- ment are given in Table XVIII of Sec. XIII, and the non- negligible covariances of the �’s are given as correlation coefficients in Table XIX of that section. These coefficients are as large as 0.9999. m. Transition frequencies between levels with n ¼ 2 and the fine-structure constant � To test the QED predictions, we calculate the values of the transition frequencies between levels with n ¼ 2 in hydrogen. This is done by running the least-squares adjustment with the hydrogen and deuterium spectroscopic data included, but excluding experimental values for the transitions being cal- culated (items A39, A40:1, and A40:2 in Table XVIII). The necessary constants ArðeÞ, ArðpÞ, ArðdÞ, and � are assigned their 2010 adjusted values. The results are �Hð2P1=2�2S1=2Þ¼1057844:4ð1:8ÞkHz ½1:7�10�6�; �Hð2S1=2�2P3=2Þ¼9911197:1ð1:8ÞkHz ½1:8�10�7�; �Hð2P1=2�2P3=2Þ¼10969041:571ð41ÞkHz ½3:7�10�9�; (87) which are consistent with the relevant experimental results given in Table XVIII. There is a significant reduction in uncertainty in these frequencies compared to the correspond- ing 2006 theoretical values. We obtain a value for the fine-structure constant � from the data on the hydrogen and deuterium transitions. This is done by running a variation of the 2010 least-squares adjustment that includes all the transition-frequency data in Table XVIII and the 2010 adjusted values of ArðeÞ, ArðpÞ, and ArðdÞ. This yields ��1 ¼ 137:036 003ð41Þ ½3:0� 10�7�; (88) which is in excellent agreement with, but substantially less accurate than, the 2010 recommended value, and is included in Table XXV. n. Isotope shift and the deuteron-proton radius difference A new experimental result for the hydrogen-deuterium isotope shift is included in Table XI (Parthey et al., 2010; Jentschura et al., 2011). In Jentschura et al. (2011) there is a discussion of the theory of the isotope shift, with the objective of extracting the difference of the squares of the charge radii for the deuteron and proton. The analysis in Jentschura et al. (2011) is in general agreement with the review given in the preceding sections of the present work, with a few differences in the estimates of uncertainties. As pointed out by Jentschura et al. (2011), the isotope shift is roughly given by 1540 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev.

This can be compared to the result given by the 2010 adjustment: r2d � r2p ¼ 3:819 89ð42Þ fm2; (91) which is in good agreement. (The difference of the squares of the quoted 2010 recommended values of the radii gives 87 in the last two digits of the difference, rather than 89, due to rounding.) The uncertainty follows from Eqs. (F11) and (F12) of CODATA-98. Here there is a significant reduction in the uncertainty compared to the uncertainties of the individual radii because of the large correlation coefficient (physics.nist.gov/constants) rðrd; rpÞ ¼ 0:9989: (92) Part of the reduction in uncertainty in Eq. (91) compared to Eq. (90) is due to the fact that the correlation coefficient takes into account the covariance of the electron-nucleon mass ratios in Eq. (89). 2. Experiments on hydrogen and deuterium The hydrogen and deuterium transition frequencies used in the 2010 adjustment for the determination of the Rydberg constant R1 are given in Table XI. These are items A26 to A48 in Table XVIII, Sec. XIII. There are only three differ- ences between Table XI in this report and the corresponding Table XII in CODATA-06. First, the last two digits of the 1S1=2–2S1=2 transition frequency obtained by the group at the Max-Planck- Institute für Quantenoptik (MPQ), Garching, Germany have changed from 74 to 80 as a result of the group’s improved measurement of the 2S hydrogen hyperfine splitting fre- quency (HFS). Their result is (Kolachevsky et al., 2009) �HFSðH; 2SÞ ¼ 177 556 834:3ð6:7Þ Hz ½3:8� 10�8�: (93) The reduction in the uncertainty of their previous value for this frequency (Kolachevsky et al., 2004) by a factor of 2.4 was mainly due to the use of a new ultrastable optical reference (Alnis et al., 2008) and a reanalysis of the shift with pressure of the 2S HFS frequency that showed it was negligible in their apparatus. The 2S HFS enters the determination of the 1S1=2–2S1=2 transition frequency because the transition actually measured is ð1S; F ¼ 1; mF ¼ 1Þ ! ð2S; F0 ¼ 1; m0F ¼ 1Þ and the well-known 1S HFS (Ramsey, 1990) and TABLE XI.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 the 2S HFS are required to convert the measured frequency to the frequency of the hyperfine centroid. For completeness, we note that the MPQ group has very recently reported a new value for the 1S1=2–2S1=2 transition frequency that has an uncertainty of 10 Hz, corresponding to a relative standard uncertainty of 4:2� 10�15, or about 30% of the uncertainty of the value in the table (Parthey et al., 2011). Second, the previousMPQvalue (Huber et al., 1998) for the hydrogen-deuterium 1S–2S isotope shift, that is, the frequency difference �Dð1S1=2–2S1=2Þ � �Hð1S1=2–2S1=2Þ, has been re- placed by their recent, much more accurate value (Parthey et al., 2010); its uncertainty of 15 Hz, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 2:2� 10�11, is a factor of 10 smaller than the uncertainty of their previous result. Many experimen- tal advances enabled this significant uncertainty reduction, not the least of which was the use of a fiber frequency comb referenced to an active hydrogen maser steered by the Global Positioning System (GPS) to measure laser frequen- cies. The principal uncertainty components in the measure- ment are 11 Hz due to density effects in the atomic beam, 6 Hz from second-order Doppler shift, and 5.1 Hz statistical. Third, Table XI includes a new result from the group at the Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel (LKB), École Normale Supérieure et Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France. These researchers have extended their previous work and determined the 1S1=2–3S1=2 transition frequency in hydrogen using Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy with a relative uncertainty of 4:4� 10�12 (Arnoult et al., 2010), the second smallest uncertainty for a hydrogen or deuterium optical transition frequency ever obtained. The transition occurs at a wavelength of 205 nm, and light at this wavelength was obtained by twice doubling the fre- quency of light emitted by a titanium-sapphire laser of wave- length 820 nm whose frequency was measured using an optical frequency comb. A significant problem in the experiment was the second- order Doppler effect due to the velocity v of the 1S atomic beam which causes an apparent shift of the transition fre- quency. The velocity was measured by having the beam pass through a transverse magnetic field, thereby inducing a mo- tional electric field and hence a quadratic Stark shift that varies as v2. The variation of this Stark shift with field was used to determine v and thus the correction for the second-order Doppler effect. The dominant 12.0 kHz uncertainty component in the LKB experiment is statistical, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 4:1� 10�12; the remaining components to- gether contribute an additional uncertainty of only 4.8 kHz. As discussed in CODATA-98, some of the transition fre- quencies measured in the same laboratory are correlated. Table XIX, Sec. XIII, gives the relevant correlation coefficients. 3. Nuclear radii Transition frequencies in hydrogen and deuterium depend on the rms charge radius of the nucleus, denoted by rp and rd, respectively. The main difference between energy levels for a point charge nucleus and for a nucleus with a finite charge radius is given by Eq. (74). These radii are treated as adjusted constants, so the H and D experimental transition-frequency input data, together with theory, provide adjusted values for them. a. Electron scattering The radii can also be determined from elastic electron- proton (e-p) scattering data in the case of rp, and from elastic electron-deuteron (e-d) scattering data in the case of rd. These independently determined values are used as additional input data which, together with the H and D spectroscopic data and the theory, determine the 2010 recommended values of the radii. The experimental electron-scattering values of rp and rd that we take as input data in the 2010 adjustment are rp ¼ 0:895ð18Þ fm; (94) rp ¼ 0:8791ð79Þ fm; (95) rd ¼ 2:130ð10Þ fm: (96) The first result for rp, which was also used in the 2002 and 2006 adjustments, is due toSick (2003, 2007, 2008) and is based on a reanalysis of the world e-p cross section and polarization transfer data. The value in Eq. (94) is consistent with the more accurate result rp ¼ 0:894ð8Þ fm reported after the closing date of the 2010 adjustment by Sick (2011) using an improved method to treat the proton’s charge density at large radii. It is also consistent with the very recent result rp ¼ 0:886ð8Þ fm calculated by Sick (2012) that extends this method and is based in part on the data obtained by Bernauer et al. (2010) in the experiment that yields the second result for rp, which we now discuss. [Note that the recent paper of Sick (2012) gives an overview of the problems associatedwith determining a reliable value of rp from e-p scattering data. Indeed, Adamuscin, Dubnicka, and Dubnickova (2012) find rp ¼ 0:849ð7Þ fm based on a reanalysis of selected nucleon form-factor data; see also Arrington, Melnitchouk, and Tjon (2007).] The value of rp given in Eq. (95) was obtained at the Mainz University, Germany, with the Mainz linear electron accel- erator MAMI. About 1400 elastic e-p scattering cross sec- tions were measured at six beam energies from 180 MeV to 855 MeV, covering the range of four-momentum transfers squared from Q2 ¼ 0:004 ðGeV=cÞ2 to 1 ðGeV=cÞ2. The value of rp was extracted from the data using spline fits or polynomial fits, and because the reason for the comparatively small difference between the resulting values could not be identified, Bernauer et al. (2010) give as their final result the average of the two values with an added uncertainty equal to half the difference. [Note that the value in Eq. (95) contains extra digits provided by Bernauer (2010); see also Arrington (2011) and Bernauer et al. (2011).] The result for rd is that given by Sick (2008) and is based on an analysis of the world data on e-d scattering similar to that used to determine the value of rp in Eq. (94). For completeness we note the recent e-p scattering result for rp based in part on new data obtained in the range Q 2 ¼ 0:3 ðGeV=cÞ2 to 0:7 ðGeV=cÞ2 at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Newport News, Virginia, USA, often referred to as simply JLab. The new data, ac- quired using a technique called polarization transfer or recoil polarimetry, were combined with previous cross section and 1542 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 polarization measurements to produce the result rp ¼ 0:875ð10Þ fm from an updated global fit in this range of Q2 (Ron et al., 2011; Zhan et al., 2011). It is independent of and agrees with the Mainz result in Eq. (95), and it also agrees with the result in Eq. (94) but the two are not independent since the data used to obtain the latter result were included in the JLab fit. This result became available after the 31 December 2010 closing date of the 2010 adjustment. b. Muonic hydrogen Amuonic hydrogen atom,��p, consists of a negativemuon and a proton. Since m�=me � 207, the Bohr radius of the muon is about 200 times smaller than the electron Bohr radius, so themuon ismore sensitive to the size of the nucleus. Indeed, the finite-size effect for the 2S state in ��p is about 2% of the total Lamb shift, that is, the energy difference between the 2S and 2P states, which should make it an ideal system for measuring the size of the proton. (Because of the large electron vacuum-polarization effect in muonic hydrogen, the 2S1=2 level is well below both the 2P3=2 and 2P1=2 levels.) In a seminal experiment carried out using pulsed laser spectroscopy at a specially built muon beam line at the proton accelerator of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland, Pohl et al. (2010, 2011) measured the 206 meV (50 THz or 6 �m) ��p Lamb shift, in particular, the 2S1=2ðF ¼ 1Þ � 2P3=2ðF ¼ 2Þ transition, with an impres- sive relative standard uncertainty of 15 parts in 106. The result, when combined with the theoretical expression for the transition, leads to (Jentschura, 2011b) rp ¼ 0:841 69ð66Þ fm: (97) The value given in Eq. (97) is based on a review and reanalysis of the theory by Jentschura (2011b, 2011c) but is not significantly different from the value first given by Pohl et al. (2010). Because the muonic hydrogen value of rp differs markedly from the 2006 CODATA recommended value given in CODATA-06, its publication in 2010 has led to a signifi- cant number of papers that reexamine various aspects of the theory or propose possible reasons for the disagree- ment; see, for example, the recent review of Borie (2012). If Eq. (97) is compared to the 2010 recommended value of 0.8775(51) fm, the disagreement is 7�. If it is compared to the value 0.8758(77) fm based on only H and D spectroscopic data (see Table XXXVIII), the disagreement is 4:4�. (Throughout the paper, � as used here is the standard uncer- tainty udiff of the difference between two values.) The impact of including Eq. (97) on the 2010 adjustment and the reasons the Task Group decided not to include it are discussed in Sec. XIII.B.2. We also note the following fact. If the least-squares adjustment that leads to the value of � given in Eq. (88) is carried out with the value in Eq. (97) added as an input datum, the result is ��1 ¼ 137:035 881ð35Þ ½2:6� 10�7�, which differs from the 2010 recommended value by 3:4�. The value of R1 from this adjustment is 10 973 731:568 016ð49Þ m�1. B. Antiprotonic helium transition frequencies and ArðeÞ Consisting of a 4He or a 3He nucleus, an antiproton, and an electron, the antiprotonic helium atom is a three-body system denoted by �pHeþ. Because it is assumed that CPT is a valid symmetry, determination of the antiproton-electron mass ratio from antiprotonic helium experiments can be interpreted as determination of the proton-electron mass ratio. Further, because the relative atomic mass of the proton ArðpÞ is known with a significantly smaller relative uncertainty from other data than is ArðeÞ, a value of the antiproton-electron mass ratio with a sufficiently small uncertainty can provide a competitive value of ArðeÞ. Theoretical and experimental values of frequencies corre- sponding to transitions between atomic levels of the antipro- tons with large principal quantum number n and angular momentum quantum number l, such that n � lþ 1 � 38, were used to obtain a value of ArðeÞ in the 2006 adjustment. Table XII summarizes the relevant experimental and theo- retical data. The first column indicates the mass number of the helium nucleus of the antiprotonic atom and the principal and TABLE XII. Summary of data related to the determination of ArðeÞ from measurements of antiprotonic helium. The uncertainties of the 15 calculated values are the root sum square (rss) of the following 15 pairs of uncertainty components in MHz, where the first component reflects the possible size of uncalculated terms of order R1�5 ln� and higher, and the second component reflects the uncertainty of the numerical calculations: (0.8, 0.2); (1.0, 0.3); (1.1, 0.3); (1.1, 0.3); (1.1, 0.4); (1.0, 0.8); (1.8, 0.4); (1.6, 0.3); (2.1, 0.3); (0.9, 0.1); (1.1, 0.2); (1.1, 0.4); (1.1, 0.3); (1.8, 0.3); (2.2, 0.2).

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 angular momentum quantum numbers of the energy levels involved in the transitions. The second column gives the experimentally measured values of the transition frequencies while the third gives the theoretically calculated values. The last two columns give the values in the unit 2cR1 of quan- tities a and b used in the observational equations that relate the experimental values of the transition frequencies to their calculated values and relevant adjusted constants, as dis- cussed in the next section. Besides a few comparatively minor changes in some of the calculated frequencies and their uncertainties, the only significant difference between Table XII in this report and the corresponding Table XIII in CODATA-06 is the addition of recently acquired data on three two-photon transitions: ð33; 32Þ ! ð31; 30Þ and ð36; 34Þ ! ð34; 32Þ for �p4Heþ, and ð35; 33Þ ! ð33; 31Þ for �p3Heþ. It is noteworthy that Hori et al. (2011), who determined the experimental values of these three frequencies (discussed fur- ther in Sec. IV.B.2), have used the new experimental and theoretical data to obtain an important new limit. With the aid of the long-known result that the absolutevalue of the charge-to- mass ratio of p and �p are the samewithin at least 9 parts in 1011 (Gabrielse, 2006), they showed that the charge andmass ofp and �p are the samewithin 7 parts in 1010 at the 90%confidence level. 1. Theory relevant to antiprotonic helium The calculated transition frequencies in Table XII are due to Korobov (2008, 2010) and are based on the 2002 recommended values of the required fundamental constants with no uncer- tainties. Korobov’s publication updates some of the values and uncertainties of the calculated transition frequencies used in the 2006 adjustment that he provideddirectly to theTaskGroup (Korobov, 2006), but it also includes results for the �p4Heþ and �p3Heþ two-photon transition frequencies ð36; 34Þ ! ð34; 32Þ and ð35; 33Þ ! ð33; 31Þ. The calculated value for the �p4Heþ two-photon frequency ð33; 32Þ ! ð31; 30Þ was again provided directly to the Task Group by Korobov (2010), as were slightly updated values for the two other two-photon frequencies. The same calculated values of the three two-photon frequencies are also given by Hori et al. (2011). The quantities a � a�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ and b � b�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ in Table XII, also directly provided to the Task Group by Korobov (2006, 2010), are actually the numerical values of derivatives defined and used as follows (in these and other similar expressions in this section, He is either 3He or 4He). The theoretical values of the transition frequencies are functions of the mass ratios Arð�pÞ=ArðeÞ and ArðNÞ=Arð�pÞ, where N is either 4He2þ or 3He2þ, that is, the alpha particle � or helion h. If the transition frequencies as a function of these mass ratios are denoted by ��pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ, and the calculated values in Table XII by � ð0Þ �pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ, we have a�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ ¼ � Arð�pÞ ArðeÞ �ð0Þ @���pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ @ � Arð�pÞ ArðeÞ � ; (98) b�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ ¼ � ArðNÞ Arð�pÞ �ð0Þ @���pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ @ � ArðNÞ Arð�pÞ � ; (99) where ���pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ ¼ ��pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ � �ð0Þ�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ (100) and the superscript (0) denotes the fact that the 2002 CODATA values of the relative-atomic-mass ratios were used by Korobov in his calculations. The zero-order frequen- cies, mass ratios, and the derivatives a and b provide a first-order approximation to the transition frequencies as a function of changes in the mass ratios: ��pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ ¼ �ð0Þ�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ þ a�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ � �� ArðeÞ Arð�pÞ �ð0Þ�Arð�pÞ ArðeÞ � � 1 � þ b�pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ � �� Arð�pÞ ArðNÞ �ð0Þ�ArðNÞ Arð�pÞ � � 1 � þ � � � : (101) This expression is the basis for the observational equations for the measured and calculated transition frequencies as a function of the mass ratios in the least-squares adjustment; see Table XXXV, Sec. XIII. Although ArðeÞ, ArðpÞ, and ArðNÞ are adjusted constants, the principal effect of including the antiprotonic helium transition frequencies in the adjustment is to provide information about ArðeÞ. This is because inde- pendent data in the adjustment provide values of ArðpÞ and ArðNÞ with significantly smaller relative uncertainties than the uncertainty of ArðeÞ. The uncertainties of the calculated transition frequencies are taken into account by including an additive constant ��pHeðn; l:n0; l0Þ in the observational equation for each mea- sured frequency; see Tables XXXIV and XXXV in Sec. XIII. The additive constants are adjusted constants and their assigned values are zero with the uncertainties of the theoretical values. They are data items C1–C15 in Table XXII. Moreover, the input data for the additive constants are correlated; their correlation coefficients, cal- culated from information provided by Korobov (2010), are given in Table XXIII. (In the 2006 adjustment, the corre- lations between the 4He and 3He calculated frequencies were omitted.) 2. Experiments on antiprotonic helium Recent reviews of the experimental work, which is carried out at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland, have been given by Hori (2011) and by Hayano (2010). The first seven 4He and the first five 3He experimental transition frequencies in Table XII, obtained by Hori et al. (2006), were used in the 2006 adjustment and are discussed in CODATA-06. The measurements were carried out with antiprotons from the CERN antiproton decelerator and employed the technique of single-photon precision laser spectroscopy. The transition frequencies and their uncertain- ties include an extra digit beyond those reported by Hori et al. (2006) that were provided to the Task Group by Hori (2006) to reduce rounding errors. During the past four years the CERN group has been able to improve their experiment and, as noted above, 1544 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 Hori et al. (2011) have recently reported results for three transitions based on two-photon laser spectroscopy. In this work �p4Heþ or �p3Heþ atoms are irradiated by two counter- propagating laser beams that excite deep ultraviolet, nonlinear, two-photon transitions of the type ðn; lÞ ! ðn� 2; l� 2Þ. This technique reduces thermal Doppler broadening of the resonances of the antiprotonic atoms, thereby producing narrower spectral lines and reducing the uncertainties of the measured transition frequencies. In normal two-photon spectroscopy the frequencies of the two counterpropagating laser beams are the same and equal to one-half the resonance frequency. In consequence, to first order in the atom’s velocity, Doppler broadening is reduced to zero. However, normal two-photon spectroscopy is difficult to do in antiprotonic helium because of the small transition probabilities of the nonlinear two-photon transitions. The CERN group was able to mitigate this problem by using the fact that the probability can be increased some 5 orders of magnitude if the two beams have different frequencies �1 and �2 such that the virtual state of the two-photon transition is within approximately 10 GHz of a real state with quantum numbers (n� 1, l� 1) (Hori and Korobov, 2010). In this case the first-order Doppler width of the resonance is reduced by the factor j�1 � �2j=ð�1 þ �2Þ. As for the earlier data, an extra digit, provided to the Task Group by Hori (2010), has been added to the three new two- photon frequencies and their uncertainties. Further, as for the one-photon transitions used in 2006, Hori (2010) has provided the Task Group with a detailed uncertainty budget for each of the new frequencies so that their correlation coefficients could be properly evaluated. (There are no correlations between the 12 older one-photon frequencies and the 3 new two-photon frequencies.) As for the one-photon frequencies, the dominant uncertainty component for the two-photon frequencies is sta- tistical; it varies from 3.0 MHz to 6.6 MHz compared to 3.2 MHz to 13.8 MHz for the one-photon frequencies. The 15 transition frequencies are data items C16–C30 in Table XXII; all relevant correlation coefficients are given in Table XXIII. 3. Inferred value of ArðeÞ from antiprotonic helium Use of the 2010 recommended values of ArðpÞ, Arð�Þ, and ArðhÞ, the experimental and theoretical values of the 15 transition frequencies in Table XII, the correlation coeffi- cients in Table XXIII, and the observational equations in Table XXXV derived as discussed above, yields the following inferred value of the electron relative atomic mass: ArðeÞ¼0:000 548 579 909 14ð75Þ ½1:4�10�9�: (102) The �p3He data alone give a value of ArðeÞ that has an uncertainty that is 1.7 times as large as the uncertainty of the value in Eq. (102); and it is smaller by a factor 1.2 times its uncertainty. The combined result is consistent and com- petitive with other values, as discussed in Sec. XIII. C. Hyperfine structure and fine structure During the past four years two highly accurate values of the fine-structure constant � from dramatically different experiments have become available, one from the electron magnetic-moment anomaly ae and the other from h=mð87RbÞ obtained by atom recoil. They are consistent and have relative standard uncertainties of 3:7� 10�10 and 6:6� 10�10, re- spectively; see Table XXV. These uncertainties imply that for another value of � to be competitive, its relative uncertainty should be no more than about a factor of 10 larger. By equating the experimentally measured ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of a simple atom such as hydrogen, muonium Mu (�þe� atom), or positronium (eþe� atom) to its theoretical expression, one could in prin- ciple obtain a value of �, since this frequency is proportional to �2R1c. Muonium is, however, still the only atom for which both the measured value of the hyperfine frequency and its theoretical expression have sufficiently small uncertainties to be of possible interest, and even for this atom with a struc- tureless nucleus the resulting value of � is no longer com- petitive; instead, muonium provides the most accurate value of the electron-muon mass ratio, as discussed in Sec. VI.B. Also proportional to �2R1c are fine-structure transition frequencies, and thus in principal these could provide a useful value of �. However, even the most accurate measurements of such frequencies in the relatively simple one-electron atoms hydrogen and deuterium do not provide a competitive value; see Table XI and Sec. IV.A.1.m, especially Eq. (88). Rather, the experimental hydrogen fine-structure transition frequen- cies given in that table are included in the 2010 adjustment, as in past adjustments, because of their influence on the adjusted constant R1. The large natural linewidths of the 2P levels in H and D limit the accuracy with which the fine-structure frequencies in these atoms can be measured. By comparison, the 23PJ states of 4He are narrow (1.6 MHz vs 100 MHz) because they cannot decay to the ground 11S0 state by allowed electric dipole transitions. Since the energy differences between the three 23P levels and the corresponding transition frequencies can be calculated and measured with reasonably small un- certainties, it has long been hoped that the fine structure of 4He could one day provide a competitive value of �. Although the past four years has seen considerable progress toward this goal, it has not yet been reached. The fine structure of the 23PJ triplet state of 4He consists of three levels; they are, from highest to lowest, 23P0, 2 3P1, and 23P2. The three transition frequencies of interest are �01 � 29:6 GHz, �12 � 2:29 GHz, and �02 � 31:9 GHz. In a series of papers Pachucki (2006), and Pachucki and Yerokhin (2009, 2010, 2011a, 2011b), but see also Pachucki and Sapirstein (2010) and Sapirstein (2010), have significantly advanced the theory of these transitions in both helium and light heliumlike ions. Based on this work, the theory is now complete to orders m�7 and mðm=MÞ�6 (m the electron mass and m=M the electron-alpha particle mass ratio), previous disagreements among calculations have been resolved, and an estimate of uncertainty due to the uncalculated m�8 term has been made. Indeed, the uncertainty of the theoretical expression for the �02 transition, which is the most accurately known both theoretically and experimentally, is estimated to be 1.7 kHz, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 5:3� 10�8 or 2:7� 10�8 for �. Nevertheless, even if an experimental value of �02 with an uncertainty of just a few hertz were available, the uncertainty in the value of � from the helium fine structure would still be too large to be included in the 2010 adjustment. Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1545 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 In fact, the most accurate experimental value of �02 is that measured by Smiciklas and Shiner (2010) with an uncertainty of 300 Hz, corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 9:4�10�9 or 4:7� 10�9 for �. As given by Pachucki and Yerokhin (2011b), the value of � obtained by equating this experimental result and the theoretical result is ��1 ¼ 137:035 9996ð37Þ ½2:7� 10�8�, which agrees well with the two most accurate values mentioned at the start of this section but is not competitive with them. Another issue is that the agreement among different experi- mental values of the various helium fine-structure transitions and their agreement with theory is not completely satisfactory. Besides the result of Smiciklas and Shiner (2010) for �02, there is the measurement of �12 by Borbely et al. (2009), all three frequencies by Zelevinsky, Farkas, and Gabrielse (2005), �01 by Giusfredi et al. (2005), �01 by George, Lombardi, and Hessels (2001), �12 by Castillega et al. (2000), and �02 by Shiner and Dixson (1995). Graphical comparisons of these data among themselves and with theory may be found in the paper by Smiciklas and Shiner (2010). In summary, no 4He fine-structure datum is included in the 2010 adjustment, because the resulting value of � has too large an uncertainty compared to the uncertainties of the values from ae and h=mð87RbÞ. V. MAGNETIC-MOMENT ANOMALIES AND g-Factors As discussed in CODATA-06, the magnetic moment of any of the three charged leptons ‘ ¼ e, �, � is �‘ ¼ g‘ e 2m‘ s; (103) where g‘ is the g-factor of the particle,m‘ is its mass, and s is its spin. In Eq. (103), e is the (positive) elementary charge. For the negatively charged leptons ‘�, g‘ is negative. These leptons have eigenvalues of spin projection sz ¼ ℏ=2, so that �‘ ¼ g‘ 2 eℏ 2m‘ ; (104) and for the electron ℏ=2me ¼ �B, the Bohr magneton. The magnetic-moment anomaly a‘ is defined by jg‘j ¼ 2ð1þ a‘Þ; (105) where the free-electron Dirac equation gives a‘ ¼ 0. In fact, the anomaly is not zero, but is given by a‘ðthÞ ¼ a‘ðQEDÞ þ a‘ðweakÞ þ a‘ðhadÞ; (106) where the terms denoted by QED, weak, and had account for the purely quantum electrodynamic, predominantly electro- weak, and predominantly hadronic (that is, strong interaction) contributions to a‘, respectively. For a comprehensive review of the theory of ae, but particularly of a�, see Jegerlehner and Nyffeler (2009). It has long been recognized that the comparison of experimental and theoretical values of the electron and muon g-factors can test our description of nature, in particular, the standard model of particle physics, which is the theory of the electro- magnetic, weak, and strong interactions. Nevertheless, our main purpose here is not to test physical theory critically, but to obtain ‘‘best’’ values of the fundamental constants. A. Electron magnetic-moment anomaly ae and the fine-structure constant � Comparison of theory and experiment for the electron magnetic-moment anomaly gives the value for the fine- structure constant � with the smallest estimated uncertainty in the 2010 adjustment. 1. Theory of ae The QED contribution for the electron may be written as (Kinoshita, Nizic, and Okamoto, 1990) aeðQEDÞ ¼ A1 þ A2ðme=m�Þ þ A2ðme=m�Þ þ A3ðme=m�; me=m�Þ: (107) The leading term A1 is mass independent and the masses in the denominators of the ratios in A2 and A3 correspond to particles in vacuum-polarization loops. Each of the four terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (107) is expressed as a power series in the fine-structure constant �: Ai ¼ Að2Þi � � � � þ Að4Þi � � � � 2 þ Að6Þi � � � � 3 þ Að8Þi � � � � 4 þ Að10Þi � � � � 5 þ � � � ; (108) where A ð2Þ 2 ¼ Að2Þ3 ¼ Að4Þ3 ¼ 0. Coefficients proportional to ð�=�Þn are of order e2n and are referred to as 2nth-order coefficients. For i ¼ 1, the second-order coefficient is known exactly, and the fourth- and sixth-order coefficients are known analytically in terms of readily evaluated functions: A ð2Þ 1 ¼ 1 2 ; (109) A ð4Þ 1 ¼ �0:328 478 965 579 . . . ; (110) A ð6Þ 1 ¼ 1:181 241 456 . . . : (111) The eighth-order coefficient A ð8Þ 1 arises from 891 Feynman diagrams of which only a few are known analytically. Evaluation of this coefficient numerically by Kinoshita and co-workers has been underway for many years (Kinoshita, 2010). The value used in the 2006 adjustment is A ð8Þ 1 ¼ �1:7283ð35Þ as reported by Kinoshita and Nio (2006). However, and as discussed in CODATA-06, well after the 31 December 2006 closing date of the 2006 adjustment, as well as the date when the 2006 CODATA recommended values of the constantsweremadepublic, itwas discoveredbyAoyama et al. (2007) that a significant error had been made in the calculation. In particular, 2 of the 47 integrals representing 518 diagrams that had not been confirmed independently re- quired a corrected treatment of infrared divergences. The error was identified by using FORTRAN code generated by an auto- matic code generator. The new value is (Aoyama et al., 2007) A ð8Þ 1 ¼ �1:9144ð35Þ; (112) details of the calculation are given by Aoyama et al. (2008). In viewof the extensive effortmadeby theseworkers to ensure that the result in Eq. (112) is reliable, the Task Group adopts both its value and quoted uncertainty for use in the 2010 adjustment. 1546 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 Independent work is in progress on analytic calculations of eighth-order integrals; see, for example, Laporta (2001, 2008), Mastrolia and Remiddi (2001), and Laporta, Mastrolia, and Remiddi (2004). Work is also in progress on numerical calculations of the 12 672 Feynman diagrams for the tenth-order coefficient; see Aoyama et al. (2011) and references cited therein. The evaluationof the contribution to the uncertainty ofaeðthÞ from the fact that A ð10Þ 1 is unknown follows the procedure in CODATA-98 and yields A ð10Þ 1 ¼ 0:0ð4:6Þ, which contributes a standard uncertainty component to aeðthÞ of 2:7� 10�10ae. This uncertainty is larger than the uncertainty attributed toA ð10Þ 1 in CODATA-06, because the absolute value of A ð8Þ 1 has in- creased. All higher-order coefficients are assumed to be negligible. The mass-dependent coefficients for the electron based on the 2010 recommended values of the mass ratios are A ð4Þ 2 ðme=m�Þ ¼ 5:197 386 68ð26Þ � 10�7 ! 24:182� 10�10ae; (113) A ð4Þ 2 ðme=m�Þ ¼ 1:837 98ð33Þ � 10�9 ! 0:086� 10�10ae; (114) A ð6Þ 2 ðme=m�Þ ¼ �7:373 941 62ð27Þ � 10�6 ! �0:797� 10�10ae; (115) A ð6Þ 2 ðme=m�Þ ¼ �6:5830ð11Þ � 10�8 ! �0:007� 10�10ae; (116) where the standard uncertainties of the coefficients are due to the uncertainties of the mass ratios and are negligible. The contributions from A ð6Þ 3 ðme=m�; me=m�Þ and all higher-order mass-dependent terms are also negligible. Thedependenceon� ofany contributionother thanaeðQEDÞ is negligible, hence the anomaly as a function of � is given by combining QED terms that have like powers of �=�: aeðQEDÞ ¼ Cð2Þe � � � � þ Cð4Þe � � � � 2 þ Cð6Þe � � � � 3 þ Cð8Þe � � � � 4 þ Cð10Þe � � � � 5 þ � � � ; (117) with C ð2Þ e ¼ 0:5; C ð4Þ e ¼ �0:328 478 444 00; C ð6Þ e ¼ 1:181 234 017; C ð8Þ e ¼ �1:9144ð35Þ; C ð10Þ e ¼ 0:0ð4:6Þ: (118) The electroweak contribution, calculated as in CODATA- 98 but with the 2010 values of GF and sin 2�W, is aeðweakÞ ¼ 0:029 73ð52Þ � 10�12 ¼ 0:2564ð45Þ � 10�10ae: (119) The hadronic contribution can be written as aeðhadÞ ¼ að4Þe ðhadÞ þ að6aÞe ðhadÞ þ að��Þe ðhadÞ þ � � � ; (120) where a ð4Þ e ðhadÞ and að6aÞe ðhadÞ are due to hadronic vacuum polarization and are of order ð�=�Þ2 and ð�=�Þ3, respec- tively; also of order ð�=�Þ3 is að��Þ� , which is due to light-by- light vacuum polarization. The total value aeðhadÞ ¼ 1:685ð22Þ � 10�12 ¼ 1:453ð19Þ � 10�9ae (121) is the sum of the following three contributions: a ð4Þ e ðhadÞ ¼ 1:875ð18Þ � 10�12 obtained by Davier and Höcker (1998); a ð6aÞ e ðhadÞ¼�0:225ð5Þ�10�12 given by Krause (1997); and a ð��Þ e ðhadÞ¼0:035ð10Þ�10�12 as given by Prades, de Rafael, and Vainshtein (2010). In past adjustments this contribution was calculated by assuming that a ð��Þ e ¼ðme=m�Þ2að��Þ� ðhadÞ. However, Prades, de Rafael, and Vainshtein (2010) have shown that such scaling is not adequate for the neutral pion exchange contribution to a ð��Þ � ðhadÞ and have taken this into account in obtaining their above result for a ð��Þ e ðhadÞ from their muon value a ð��Þ � ðhadÞ ¼ 105ð26Þ � 10�11. The theoretical prediction is aeðthÞ ¼ aeðQEDÞ þ aeðweakÞ þ aeðhadÞ: (122) Thevarious contributions can be put into context by comparing them to the most accurate experimental value of ae currently available, which has an uncertainty of 2:8� 10�10ae; see Eq. (126). The standard uncertainty of aeðthÞ from the uncertainties of the terms listed above is u½aeðthÞ� ¼ 0:33� 10�12 ¼ 2:8� 10�10ae (123) and is dominated by the uncertainty of the coefficient C ð10Þ e . For the purpose of the least-squares calculations carried out in Sec. XIII, we include an additive correction �e to aeðthÞ to account for the uncertainty of aeðthÞ other than that due to �, and hence the complete theoretical expression in the observational equation for the electron anomaly (B13 in Table XXXIII) is aeð�; �eÞ ¼ aeðthÞ þ �e: (124) The input datum for �e is zero with standard uncertainty u½aeðthÞ�, or 0:00ð33Þ�10�12, which is data item B12 in Table XX. 2. Measurements of ae a. University of Washington The classic series of measurements of the electron and positron anomalies carried out at the University of Washington by Van Dyck, Jr., Schwinberg, and Dehmelt (1987) yield the value ae¼1:159 652 1883ð42Þ�10�3 ½3:7�10�9�; (125) as discussed in CODATA-98. This result, which assumes that CPT invariance holds for the electron-positron system, is data item B13:1 in Table XX. b. Harvard University In both the University of Washington and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA experiments, the electron Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1547 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 magnetic-moment anomaly is essentially determined from the relation ae ¼ fa=fc by measuring in the same magnetic flux density B � 5 T the anomaly difference frequency fa ¼ fs � fc and cyclotron frequency fc ¼ eB=2�me, where fs ¼ jgej�BB=h is the electron spin-flip (or precession) frequency. Because of its small relative standard uncertainty of 7:6� 10�10, the then new result for ae obtained by Odom et al. (2006) at Harvard using a cylindrical rather than a hyperbolic Penning trap played the dominant role in determining the 2006 recommended value of �. This work continued with a number of significant improvements and a new value of ae consistent with the earlier one but with an uncertainty nearly a factor of 3 smaller was reported by Hanneke, Fogwell, and Gabrielse (2008): ae ¼ 1:159 652 180 73ð28Þ � 10�3: (126) A paper that describes this measurement in detail was sub- sequently published by Hanneke, Fogwell Hoogerheide, and Gabrielse (2011) [see also the review by Gabrielse (2010)]. As discussed by Hanneke, Fogwell Hoogerheide, and Gabrielse (2011), the improvement that contributed most to the reduction in uncertainty is a better understanding of the Penning-trap cavity frequency shifts of the radiation used to measure fc. A smaller reduction resulted from narrower linewidths of the anomaly and cyclotron resonant frequen- cies. Consequently, Hanneke, Fogwell Hoogerheide, and Gabrielse (2011) state that their 2008 result should be viewed as superseding the earlier Harvard result. Therefore, only the value of ae in Eq. (126) is included as an input datum in the 2010 adjustment; it is data item B13:2 in Table XX. 3. Values of � inferred from ae Equating the theoretical expression with the two experi- mental values of ae given in Eqs. (125) and (126) yields ��1ðaeÞ¼137:03599819ð50Þ ½3:7�10�9� (127) from the University of Washington result and ��1ðaeÞ¼137:035999084ð51Þ ½3:7�10�10� (128) from the Harvard University result. The contribution of the uncertainty in aeðthÞ to the relative uncertainty of either of these results is 2:8� 10�10. The value in Eq. (128) has the smallest uncertainty of any value of alpha currently available. The fact that the next most accurate value of �, which has a relative standard uncertainty of 6:6� 10�10 and is obtained from the quotient h=mð87RbÞ measured by atom recoil, is consistent with this value suggests that the theory of ae is well in hand; see Sec. XIII. B. Muon magnetic-moment anomaly a� The 2006 adjustment included data that provided both an experimental value and a theoretical value for a�. Because of problems with the theory, the uncertainty assigned to the theoretical value was over 3 times larger than that of the experimental value. Nevertheless, the theoretical value with its increased uncertainty was included in the adjustment, even if with a comparatively small weight. For the 2010 adjustment, the Task Group decided not to include the theoretical value for a�, with the result that the 2010 recommended value is based mainly on experiment. This is consistent with the fact that the value of a� recom- mended by the Particle Data Group in their biennial 2010 Review of Particle Physics (Nakamura et al., 2010) is the experimental value. The current situation is briefly summa- rized in the following sections. 1. Theory of a� Themass-independent coefficients A ðnÞ 1 for the muon are the same as for the electron. Based on the 2010 recommended values of the mass ratios, the relevant mass-dependent terms are A ð4Þ 2 ðm�=meÞ ¼ 1:094 258 3118ð81Þ ! 506 386:4620ð38Þ � 10�8a�; (129) A ð4Þ 2 ðm�=m�Þ ¼ 0:000 078 079ð14Þ ! 36:1325ð65Þ � 10�8a�; (130) A ð6Þ 2 ðm�=meÞ ¼ 22:868 380 04ð19Þ ! 24 581:766 56ð20Þ � 10�8a�; (131) A ð6Þ 2 ðm�=m�Þ ¼ 0:000 360 63ð11Þ ! 0:387 65ð12Þ � 10�8a�; (132) A ð8Þ 2 ðm�=meÞ ¼ 132:6823ð72Þ ! 331:288ð18Þ � 10�8a�; (133) A ð10Þ 2 ðm�=meÞ ¼ 663ð20Þ ! 3:85ð12Þ � 10�8a�; (134) A ð6Þ 3 ðm�=me; m�=m�Þ ¼ 0:000 527 762ð94Þ ! 0:567 30ð10Þ � 10�8a�; (135) A ð8Þ 3 ðm�=me;m�=m�Þ¼0:037594ð83Þ !0:09387ð21Þ�10�8a�: (136) The QED contribution to the theory of a�, where terms that have like powers of �=� are combined, is a�ðQEDÞ ¼ Cð2Þ� � � � � þ Cð4Þ� � � � � 2 þ Cð6Þ� � � � � 3 þ Cð8Þ� � � � � 4 þ Cð10Þ� � � � � 5 þ � � � ; (137) with C ð2Þ � ¼ 0:5; C ð4Þ � ¼ 0:765 857 426ð16Þ; C ð6Þ � ¼ 24:050 509 88ð28Þ; C ð8Þ � ¼ 130:8055ð80Þ; C ð10Þ � ¼ 663ð21Þ; (138) which yields, using the 2010 recommended value of �, a�ðQEDÞ ¼ 0:001 165 847 1810ð15Þ ½1:3� 10�9�: (139) 1548 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 In absolute terms, the uncertainty in a�ðQEDÞ is 0:15� 10�11. The current theoretical expression for the muon anomaly is of the same form as for the electron: a�ðthÞ ¼ a�ðQEDÞ þ a�ðweakÞ þ a�ðhadÞ: (140) The electroweak contribution, calculated by Czarnecki et al. (2003), is a�ðweakÞ ¼ 154ð2Þ � 10�11. In contrast to the case of the electron, a�ðweakÞ is a significant contribution com- pared to a�ðQEDÞ. In a manner similar to that for the electron, the hadronic contribution can be written as a�ðhadÞ ¼ að4Þ� ðhadÞ þ að6aÞ� ðhadÞ þ að��Þ� ðhadÞ þ � � � : (141) It is also of much greater importance for the muon than for the electron. Indeed, a�ðhadÞ is roughly 7000ð50Þ � 10�11, which should be compared with the 63� 10�11 uncertainty of the experimental value a�ðexpÞ discussed in the next section. For well over a decade a great deal of effort has been devoted by many researchers to the improved evaluation of a�ðhadÞ. The standard method of calculating að4Þ� ðhadÞ and a ð6aÞ � ðhadÞ is to evaluate dispersion integrals over experimen- tally measured cross sections for the scattering of eþe� into hadrons. However, in some calculations data on decays of the � into hadrons are used to replace the eþe� data in certain energy regions. The results of three evaluations which include the most recent data can be concisely summarized as follows. Davier et al. (2011) find that a�ðexpÞ exceeds their theoretically predicted value a�ðthÞ by 3.6 times the com- bined standard uncertainty of the difference, or 3:6�, using only eþe� data, and by 2:4� if � data are included. On the other hand, Jegerlehner and Szafron (2011) find that by correcting the � data for the effect they term �-� mixing, the values of a ð4Þ � ðhadÞ obtained from only eþe� data, and from eþe� and � data together, are nearly identical and that the difference between experiment and theory is 3:3�. And Hagiwara et al. (2011) find the same 3:3� difference using eþe� data alone. Finally, we note that in a very recent paper, Benayoun et al. (2012) obtain a difference in the range 4:07� to 4:65�, depending on the assumptions made, using a ‘‘hidden local symmetry’’ model. The disagreement between experiment and theory has long been known and numerous theoretical papers have been pub- lished that attempt to explain the discrepancy in terms of new physics; see Stöckinger (2010). Although a contribution to a�ðthÞ large enough to bring it into agreement with a�ðexpÞ fromphysics beyond the standardmodel is possible, no outside experimental evidence currently exists for such physics. Thus, because of the persistence of the discrepancy and its confirma- tion by the most recent calculations, and because no known physics has yet been able to eliminate it, the Task Group has decided to omit the theory of a� from the 2010 adjustment. 2. Measurement of a�: Brookhaven Experiment E821 at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, New York, USA, has been discussed in the past three CODATA reports. It involves the direct measurement of the anomaly difference frequency fa ¼ fs � fc, where fs ¼ jg�jðeℏ=2m�ÞB=h is the muon spin-flip (or precession) frequency in the applied magnetic flux density B and fc ¼ eB=2�m� is the corresponding muon cyclotron fre- quency. However, in contrast to the case of the electron where both fa and fc are measured directly and the electron anomaly is calculated from ae ¼ fa=fc, for the muon B is eliminated by determining its value from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. This means that the muon anomaly is calculated from a�ðexpÞ ¼ �R j��=�pj � �R ; (142) where �R ¼ fa= �fp and �fp is the free proton NMR frequency corresponding to the average flux density B seen by the muons in their orbits in the muon storage ring. The final value of �R obtained in the E821 experiment is (Bennett et al., 2006) �R ¼ 0:003 707 2063ð20Þ; (143) which is used as an input datum in the 2010 adjustment and is data item B14 in Table XX. [The last digit of this value is 1 less than that of the value used in 2006, because the 2006 value was taken from Eq. (57) in the paper by Bennett et al. (2006) but the correct value is that given in Table XV (Roberts, 2009).] Based on this value of �R, Eq. (142), and the 2010 recommended value of��=�p, whose uncertainty is negligible in this context, the experimental value of the muon anomaly is a�ðexpÞ ¼ 1:165 920 91ð63Þ � 10�3: (144) Further, with the aid of Eq. (230), the equation for �R can be written as �R ¼ � a� 1þ aeð�; �eÞ me m� �e� �p ; (145) where use has been made of the relations ge ¼ �2ð1þ aeÞ, g� ¼ �2ð1þ a�Þ, and ae is replaced by the theoretical ex- pression aeð�; �eÞ given in Eq. (106). However, since the theory of a� is omitted from the 2010 adjustment, a� is not replaced in Eq. (145) by a theoretical expression, rather it is made to be an adjusted constant. C. Bound-electron g-factor in 12C5þ and in 16O7þ and ArðeÞ Competitive values of ArðeÞ can be obtained from precise measurements and theoretical calculations of the g-factor of the electron in hydrogenic 12C and 16O. For a ground-state hydrogenic ion AXðZ�1Þþ with mass number A, atomic number (proton number) Z, nuclear spin quantum number i ¼ 0, and g-factor ge�ðAXðZ�1ÞþÞ in an applied magnetic flux density B, the ratio of the electron’s spin-flip (or precession) frequency fs ¼ jge�ðAXðZ�1ÞþÞjðeℏ=2meÞB=h to the cyclotron frequency of the ion fc ¼ ðZ� 1ÞeB=2�mðAXðZ�1ÞþÞ in the same mag- netic flux density is fsðAXðZ�1ÞþÞ fcðAXðZ�1ÞþÞ ¼ � ge�ð AXðZ�1ÞþÞ 2ðZ� 1Þ ArðAXðZ�1ÞþÞ ArðeÞ ; (146) where ArðXÞ is the relative atomic mass of particle X. Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1549 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 This expression can be used to obtain a competitive result for ArðeÞ if for a particular ion the quotient fs=fc, its bound- state g-factor, and the relative atomic mass of the ion can be obtained with sufficiently small uncertainties. In fact, work underway since the mid-1990s has been so successful that Eq. (146) now provides the most accurate values of ArðeÞ. Measurements of fs=fc for 12C5þ and 16O7þ, performed at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany (GSI) by GSI and University of Mainz researchers, are discussed in CODATA-06 and the results were included in the 2006 adjustment. These data are recalled in Sec. V.C.2, and the present status of the theoretical expressions for the bound-state g-factors of the two ions are discussed in the following section. For completeness, we note that well after the closing date of the 2010 adjustment Sturm et al. (2011) reported a value of fs=fc for the hydrogenic ion 28Si13þ. Using the 2006 recommended value of ArðeÞ and the applicable version of Eq. (146), they found good agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the g-factor of this ion, thereby strengthening confidence in our understanding of bound-state QED theory. 1. Theory of the bound electron g-factor The energy of a free electron with spin projection sz in a magnetic flux density B in the z direction is E ¼ �� � B ¼ �ge� e 2me szB; (147) and hence the spin-flip energy difference is �E ¼ �ge��BB: (148) (In keeping with the definition of the g-factor in Sec. V, the quantity ge� is negative.) The analogous expression for ions with no nuclear spin is �EbðXÞ ¼ �ge�ðXÞ�BB; (149) which defines the bound-state electron g-factor, and where X is either 12C5þ or 16O7þ. The theoretical expression for ge�ðXÞ is written as ge�ðXÞ ¼ gD þ �grad þ �grec þ �gns þ � � � ; (150) where the individual terms are the Dirac value, the radiative corrections, the recoil corrections, and the nuclear-size cor- rections, respectively.

For the coefficient C ð2Þ e ðZ�Þ, we have (Faustov, 1970; Grotch, 1970; Close and Osborn, 1971; Pachucki et al., 2004, 2005) C ð2Þ e;SEðZ�Þ ¼ 1 2 � 1þ ðZ�Þ 2 6 þ ðZ�Þ4 � 32 9 lnðZ�Þ�2 þ 247 216 � 8 9 lnk0 � 8 3 lnk3 � þ ðZ�Þ5RSEðZ�Þ � ; (154) where lnk0 ¼ 2:984 128 556; (155) lnk3 ¼ 3:272 806 545; (156) RSEð6�Þ ¼ 22:160ð10Þ; (157) RSEð8�Þ ¼ 21:859ð4Þ: (158) The quantity lnk0 is the Bethe logarithm for the 1S state (see Table V), lnk3 is a generalization of the Bethe logarithm, and RSEðZ�Þ was obtained by extrapolation of the results of numerical calculations at higher Z (Yerokhin, Indelicato, and Shabaev, 2002; Pachucki et al., 2004).

The results are in agreement with, but less accurate than the extrapolation from higher Z. The lowest-order vacuum-polarization correction consists of a wave-function correction and a potential correction, each of which can be separated into a lowest-order Uehling potential contribution and a Wichmann-Kroll higher contri- bution. The wave-function correction is (Beier et al., 2000; Karshenboim, 2000; Karshenboim, Ivanov, and Shabaev, 2001a, 2001b) C ð2Þ e;VPwfð6�Þ ¼ �0:000 001 840 3431ð43Þ; C ð2Þ e;VPwfð8�Þ ¼ �0:000 005 712 028ð26Þ: (160) For the potential correction, we have (Beier, 2000; Beier et al., 2000; Karshenboim and Milstein, 2002; Lee et al., 2005; Mohr and Taylor, 2005) C ð2Þ e;VPpð6�Þ ¼ 0:000 000 008 08ð12Þ; C ð2Þ e;VPpð8�Þ ¼ 0:000 000 033 73ð50Þ; (161) which is the unweighted average of two slightly inconsistent results with an uncertainty of half their difference. The total one-photon vacuum-polarization coefficients are given by the sum of Eqs.

The leading binding correction to the higher-order coef- ficients is (Eides and Grotch, 1997a; Czarnecki, Melnikov, and Yelkhovsky, 2000) C ð2nÞ e ðZ�Þ ¼ Cð2nÞe � 1þ ðZ�Þ 2 6 þ � � � � : (165) The two-loop contribution of relative order ðZ�Þ4 for the ground S state is (Pachucki et al., 2005; Jentschura et al., 2006) C ð4Þ e ðZ�Þ ¼ Cð4Þe � 1þ ðZ�Þ 2 6 � þ ðZ�Þ4 � 14 9 lnðZ�Þ�2 þ 991 343 155 520 � 2 9 lnk0 � 4 3 lnk3 þ 679�2 12 960 � 1441� 2 720 ln2þ 1441 480 ð3Þ � þOðZ�Þ5 ¼ �0:328 5778ð23Þ for Z ¼ 6 ¼ �0:328 6578ð97Þ for Z ¼ 8; (166) where lnk0 and lnk3 are given in Eqs.

As in CODATA-06, the uncertainty due to uncalculated terms is taken to be (Pachucki et al., 2005) u½Cð4Þe ðZ�Þ� ¼ 2jðZ�Þ5Cð4Þe RSEðZ�Þj: (167) Jentschura (2009) has calculated a two-loop gauge-invariant set of vacuum-polarization diagrams to obtain a contribution of the same order in Z� as the above uncertainty. However, in general we do not include partial results of a given order. Jentschura also speculates that the complete term of that order could be somewhat larger than our uncertainty. The three- and four-photon terms are calculated with the leading binding correction included: C ð6Þ e ðZ�Þ ¼ Cð6Þe � 1þ ðZ�Þ 2 6 þ � � � � ¼ 1:181 611 . . . for Z ¼ 6 ¼ 1:181 905 . . . for Z ¼ 8; (168) where C ð6Þ e ¼ 1:181 234 . . . , and C ð8Þ e ðZ�Þ ¼ Cð8Þe � 1þ ðZ�Þ 2 6 þ � � � � ¼ �1:9150ð35Þ . . . for Z ¼ 6 ¼ �1:9155ð35Þ . . . for Z ¼ 8; (169) where C ð8Þ e ¼ �1:9144ð35Þ. An uncertainty estimate C ð10Þ e ðZ�Þ � Cð10Þe ¼ 0:0ð4:6Þ (170) is included for the five-loop correction.

The mass ratios, obtained from the 2010 adjustment, are me=mð12C6þÞ ¼ 0:000 045 727 5 . . . and me=mð16O8þÞ¼0:0000343065... . The recoil terms are the same as in CODATA-02 and references to the original calculations are given there. An additional term of the order of the mass ratio squared (Eides and Grotch, 1997a; Eides, 2002) ð1þ ZÞðZ�Þ2 � me mN � 2 (172) should also be included in the theory. The validity of this term for a nucleus of any spin has been reconfirmed by Pachucki (2008), Eides and Martin (2010), and Eides and Martin (2011). For �g ð2Þ rec, we have �g ð2Þ rec ¼ � � ðZ�Þ2 3 me mN þ � � � ¼ 0:000 000 000 06 . . . for Z ¼ 6 ¼ 0:000 000 000 09 . . . for Z ¼ 8: (173) There is a small correction to the bound-state g-factor due to the finite size of the nucleus, of order (Karshenboim, 2000) �gns ¼ � 8 3 ðZ�Þ4 � RN C � 2 þ � � � ; (174) where RN is the bound-state nuclear rms charge radius and C is the Compton wavelength of the electron divided by 2�. This term is calculated by scaling the results of Glazov and Shabaev (2002) with the squares of updated values for the nuclear radii RN ¼ 2:4703ð22Þ fm and RN ¼ 2:7013ð55Þ fm from the compilation of Angeli (2004) for 12C and 16O, respectively. This yields the correction �gns ¼ �0:000 000 000 408ð1Þ for 12C; �gns ¼ �0:000 000 001 56ð1Þ for 16O: (175) The theoretical value for the g-factor of the electron in hydrogenic carbon 12 or oxygen 16 is the sum of the indi- vidual contributions discussed above and summarized in Tables XIII and XIV: ge�ð12C5þÞ ¼ �2:001 041 590 181ð26Þ; ge�ð16O7þÞ ¼ �2:000 047 020 35ð11Þ: (176) For the purpose of the least-squares calculations carried out in Sec. XIII, we define gCðthÞ to be the sum of gD as given in Eq. (151), the term�2ð�=�ÞCð2Þe , and the numerical values of the remaining terms in Eq. (150) as given in Table XIII, where the standard uncertainty of these latter terms is u½gCðthÞ�¼0:3�10�10¼1:3�10�11jgCðthÞj: (177) The uncertainty in gCðthÞ due to the uncertainty in � enters the adjustment primarily through the functional dependence of gD and the term �2ð�=�ÞCð2Þe on �. Therefore this par- ticular component of uncertainty is not explicitly included in u½gCðthÞ�. To take the uncertainty u½gCðthÞ� into account we employ as the theoretical expression for the g-factor (B17 in Table XXXIII) gCð�; �CÞ ¼ gCðthÞ þ �C; (178) where the input value of the additive correction �C is taken to be zero with standard uncertainty u½gCðthÞ�, or 0:00ð26Þ � 10�10, which is data item B15 in Table XX. Analogous considerations apply for the g-factor in oxygen, where u½gOðthÞ� ¼ 1:1� 10�10 ¼ 5:3� 10�11jgOðthÞj (179) and (B18 in Table XXXIII) gOð�; �OÞ ¼ gOðthÞ þ �O: (180) The input value for �O is 0:0ð1:1Þ � 10�10, which is data item B16 in Table XX. The covariance of the quantities �C and �O is uð�C; �OÞ ¼ 27� 10�22; (181) which corresponds to a correlation coefficient of rð�C; �OÞ ¼ 0:994. The theoretical value of the ratio of the two g-factors is ge�ð12C5þÞ ge�ð16O7þÞ ¼ 1:000 497 273 224ð40Þ; (182) where the covariance of the two values is taken into account. 2. Measurements of geð12C5þÞ and geð16O7þÞ The experimental values of fs=fc for 12C5þ and 16O7þ obtained at GSI using the double Penning-trap method are discussed in CODATA-02 and the slightly updated result for the oxygen ion is discussed in CODATA-06. For 12C5þ we have (Beier et al., 2001; Häffner et al., 2003; Werth, 2003) fsð12C5þÞ fcð12C5þÞ ¼ 4376:210 4989ð23Þ; (183) while for 16O7þ we have (Tomaselli et al., 2002; Verdú et al., 2004; Verdú, 2006) fsð16O7þÞ fcð16O7þÞ ¼ 4164:376 1837ð32Þ: (184) The correlation coefficient of these two frequency ratios, which are data items B17 and B18 in Table XX, is 0.082. Equations (1) and (146) together yield fsð12C5þÞ fcð12C5þÞ ¼ � ge�ð 12C5þÞ 10ArðeÞ � 12� 5ArðeÞ þ Ebð 12CÞ � Ebð12C5þÞ muc 2 � ; (185) which is the basis of the observational equation for the 12C5þ frequency ratio input datum, Eq. (183); see B17 in Table XXXIII. In a similar manner we may write fsð16O7þÞ fcð16O7þÞ ¼ � ge�ð 16O7þÞ 14ArðeÞ Arð16O7þÞ; (186) with Arð16OÞ ¼ Arð16O7þÞ þ 7ArðeÞ � Ebð16OÞ � Ebð16O7þÞ muc 2 ; (187) 1552 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 which are the basis for the observational equations for the oxygen frequency ratio and Arð16OÞ, respectively; see B18 and B8 in Table XXXIII. Evaluation of Eq. (185) using the result for the carbon frequency ratio in Eq. (183), the theoretical result for ge�ð12C5þÞ in Table XIII of this report, and the relevant binding energies in Table IV of CODATA-02, yields ArðeÞ¼0:00054857990932ð29Þ ½5:2�10�10�: (188) A similar calculation for oxygen using the value of Arð16OÞ in Table III yields ArðeÞ¼0:00054857990957ð42Þ ½7:6�10�10�: (189) These values of ArðeÞ are consistent with each other. Finally, as a further consistency test, the experimental and theoretical values of the ratio of ge�ð12C5þÞ to ge�ð16O7þÞ can be compared (Karshenboim and Ivanov, 2002). The theoreti- cal value of the ratio is given in Eq. (182) and the experi- mental value is ge�ð12C5þÞ ge�ð16O7þÞ ¼ 1:000 497 273 68ð89Þ ½8:9� 10�10�; (190) in agreement with the theoretical value. VI. MAGNETIC-MOMENT RATIOS AND THE MUON-ELECTRON MASS RATIO Magnetic-moment ratios and the muon-electron mass ratio are determined by experiments on bound states of the relevant particles and must be corrected to determine the free-particle moments. For nucleons or nuclei with spin I, the magnetic moment can be written as � ¼ g e 2mp I; (191) or � ¼ g�Ni: (192) In Eq. (192), �N ¼ eℏ=2mp is the nuclear magneton, defined in analogy with the Bohr magneton, and i is the spin quantum number of the nucleus defined by I2 ¼ iðiþ 1Þℏ2 and Iz ¼ �iℏ; . . . ; ði� 1Þℏ, iℏ, where Iz is the spin projection. Bound-state g-factors for atoms with a nonzero nuclear spin are defined by considering their interactions in an ap- plied magnetic flux density B. For hydrogen, in the Pauli approximation, we have H ¼ ðHÞ�e� ��p ��e�ðHÞ � B��pðHÞ � B ¼ 2� ℏ ��Hs � I� ge�ðHÞ �B ℏ s � B� gpðHÞ �N ℏ I � B; (193) where ðHÞ characterizes the strength of the hyperfine interaction, ��H is the ground-state hyperfine frequency, s is the spin of the electron, and I is the spin of the nucleus. Equation (193) defines the corresponding bound-state g-factors ge�ðHÞ and gpðHÞ. A. Magnetic-moment ratios Theoretical binding corrections relate g-factors measured in the bound state to the corresponding free-particle g-factors. The corrections are sufficiently small that the adjusted constants used to calculate them are taken as exactly known. These corrections and the references for the relevant calcu- lations are discussed in CODATA-98 and CODATA-02. 1.

(194)–(201), based on the 2010 adjusted values of the relevant constants, are listed in Table XV; uncertainties are negligible here. An addi- tional term of order �ðZ�Þ5 relevant to Eqs. (195), (198), and (201) has been calculated by Ivanov, Karshenboim, and Lee (2009), but it is negligible at the present level of uncertainty. 2. Bound helion to free helion magnetic-moment ratio �0h=�h The bound helion to free helion magnetic-moment ratio correction �h, defined by �0h �h ¼ 1� �h; (202) has been calculated by Rudziński, Puchalski, and Pachucki (2009), who obtain �h ¼ 59:967 43ð10Þ � 10�6 ½1:7� 10�6�: (203) This provides a recommended value for the unshielded helion magnetic moment, along with other related quantities. 3. Ratio measurements Since all of the experimental bound-state magnetic- moment ratios of interest for the 2010 adjustment are dis- cussed in one or more of the previous three CODATA reports, only minimal information is given here. The relevant input data are items B19–B27 of Table XX and their respective observational equations are B19–B27 in Table XXXIII. The adjusted constants in those equations may be identified using Table XXXII, and theoretical bound-particle to free-particle g-factor ratios, which are taken to be exact, are given in Table XV. The symbol �0p denotes the magnetic moment of a proton in a spherical sample of pure H2O at 25 �C sur- rounded by vacuum; and the symbol�0h denotes the magnetic moment of a helion bound in a 3He atom. Although the exact shape and temperature of the gaseous 3He sample is unimportant, we assume that it is spherical, at 25 �C, and surrounded by vacuum. Item B19, labeled MIT-72, is the ratio �e�ðHÞ=�pðHÞ in the 1S state of hydrogen obtained at MIT by Winkler et al. (1972) and Kleppner (1997); and B20, labeled MIT-84, is the ratio �dðDÞ=�e�ðDÞ in the 1S state of deuterium also ob- tained at MIT (Phillips, Kleppner, and Walther, 1984). Item B21 with identification StPtrsb-03 is the magnetic- moment ratio �pðHDÞ=�dðHDÞ, and B23 with the same identification is the ratio �tðHTÞ=�pðHTÞ, both of which were determined from NMR measurements on the HD and HT molecules (bound state of hydrogen and deuterium and of hydrogen and tritium, respectively) by researchers working at institutes in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation (Neronov and Karshenboim, 2003; Karshenboim et al., 2005). Here �pðHDÞ and �dðHDÞ are the proton and the deuteron mag- netic moments in HD, and �tðHTÞ and �pðHTÞ are the triton and the proton magnetic moments in HT. Items B22 and B24, also with the identifications StPtrsb-03 and due to Neronov and Karshenboim (2003) and Karshenboim et al. (2005), are defined according to �dp � �dðHDÞ � �pðHDÞ and �tp � �tðHTÞ � �pðHTÞ, where �pðHDÞ, �dðHDÞ, �tðHTÞ, and �pðHTÞ are the corresponding nuclear magnetic shielding corrections, which are small: �ðboundÞ ¼ ð1� �Þ�ðfreeÞ. We note that after the 31 December 2010 closing date of the 2010 adjustment, Neronov and Aleksandrov (2011) re- ported a result for the ratio �tðHTÞ=�pðHTÞ with a relative standard uncertainty of 7� 10�10 and which is consistent with data item B23. Item B25, labeled MIT-77, is the ratio�e�ðHÞ=�0p obtained at MIT by Phillips, Cooke, and Kleppner (1977), where the electron is in the 1S state of hydrogen. The results of Petley and Donaldson (1984) are used to correct the measured value of the ratio based on a spherical H2O NMR sample at 34:7 �C to the reference temperature 25 �C. Item B26 with identification NPL-93 is the ratio �0h=� 0 p determined at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Teddington, UK, by Flowers, Petley, and Richards (1993). And B27, labeled ILL-79, is the neutron to shielded proton magnetic-moment ratio �n=� 0 p determined at the Institut Max von Laue-Paul Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France (Greene et al., 1977, 1979). B. Muonium transition frequencies, the muon-proton magnetic-moment ratio ��=�p, and muon-electron mass ratio m�=me Experimental frequencies for transitions between Zeeman energy levels in muonium Mu provide measured values of ��=�p and the muonium ground-state hyperfine splitting ��Mu that depend only on the commonly used Breit-Rabi equation (Breit and Rabi, 1931).

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 The theoretical expression for the hyperfine splitting ��MuðthÞ is discussed in the following section and may be written as ��MuðthÞ ¼ 16 3 cR1�2 me m� � 1þ me m� ��3 F ð�;me=m�Þ ¼ ��FF ð�;me=m�Þ; (204) where the function F depends weakly on � and me=m�. 1. Theory of the muonium ground-state hyperfine splitting Presented here is a brief summary of the present theory of ��Mu. Complete results of the relevant calculations are given along with references to new work; references to the original literature included in earlier CODATA reports are not repeated. The hyperfine splitting is given mainly by the Fermi formula: ��F ¼ 16 3 cR1Z3�2 me m� � 1þ me m� ��3 : (205) In order to identify the source of the terms, some of the theoretical expressions are for a muon with charge Ze rather than e. The general expression for the hyperfine splitting is ��MuðthÞ ¼ ��D þ ��rad þ��rec þ ��r-r þ ��weak þ ��had; (206) where the terms labeled D, rad, rec, r-r, weak, and had account for the Dirac, radiative, recoil, radiative-recoil, elec- troweak, and hadronic contributions to the hyperfine splitting, respectively. The Dirac equation yields ��D ¼ ��Fð1þ a�Þ � 1þ 3 2 ðZ�Þ2 þ 17 8 ðZ�Þ4 þ � � � � ; (207) where a� is the muon magnetic-moment anomaly. The radiative corrections are ��rad ¼ ��Fð1þ a�Þ � Dð2ÞðZ�Þ � � � � þDð4ÞðZ�Þ � � � � 2 þDð6ÞðZ�Þ � � � � 3 þ � � � � ; (208) where the functions Dð2nÞðZ�Þ are contributions from n vir- tual photons. The leading term is Dð2ÞðZ�Þ ¼ Að2Þ1 þ � ln2� 5 2 � �Z� þ � �2 3 ln2ðZ�Þ�2 þ � 281 360 � 8 3 ln2 � lnðZ�Þ�2 þ 16:9037 . . . � ðZ�Þ2 þ �� 5 2 ln2� 547 96 � lnðZ�Þ�2 � �ðZ�Þ3 þGðZ�ÞðZ�Þ3; (209) where A ð2Þ 1 ¼ 12 , as in Eq. (109). The function GðZ�Þ accounts for all higher-order contributions in powers of Z�; it can be divided into self energy and vacuum- polarization contributions, GðZ�Þ ¼ GSEðZ�Þ þ GVPðZ�Þ. Yerokhin and Jentschura (2008, 2010) have calculated the one-loop self energy for the muonium HFS with the result GSEð�Þ ¼ �13:8308ð43Þ (210) which agrees with the value GSEð�Þ ¼ �13:8ð3Þ from an earlier calculation by Yerokhin et al. (2005), as well as with other previous estimates. The vacuum-polarization part is GVPð�Þ ¼ 7:227ð9Þ: (211) For Dð4ÞðZ�Þ, we have Dð4ÞðZ�Þ ¼ Að4Þ1 þ 0:770 99ð2Þ�Z� þ � � 1 3 ln2ðZ�Þ�2 � 0:6390 . . .� lnðZ�Þ�2 þ 10ð2:5Þ � ðZ�Þ2 þ � � � ; (212) where A ð4Þ 1 is given in Eq. (110). Calculation of the coefficient of �Z� is summarized in CODATA-98; the quoted value with a slightly smaller uncertainty is given by Mondéjar, Piclum, and Czarnecki (2010). The next term is Dð6ÞðZ�Þ ¼ Að6Þ1 þ � � � ; (213) where the leading contribution A ð6Þ 1 is given in Eq. (111), but only partial results of relative order Z� have been calculated (Eides and Shelyuto, 2007). Higher-order functions Dð2nÞðZ�Þ with n > 3 are expected to be negligible.

Partial radiative-recoil results are given by Eides and Shelyuto (2009a, 2009b, 2010), and are summarized as ��ES ¼ ��F � � � � 3 me m� �� 3 ð3Þ � 6�2 ln2þ �2 � 8 � � lnm� me þ 63:127ð2Þ � ¼ �34:7 Hz: (216) The electroweak contribution due to the exchange of a Z0 boson is (Eides, 1996) ��weak ¼ �65 Hz; (217) while for the hadronic vacuum-polarization contribution we have (Eidelman, Karshenboim, and Shelyuto, 2002) ��had ¼ 236ð4Þ Hz; (218) as in CODATA-06. A negligible contribution (� 0:0065 Hz) from the hadronic light-by-light correction has been given by Karshenboim, Shelyuto, and Vainshtein (2008). Tau vacuum polarization contributes 3 Hz, which is also negligible at the present level of uncertainty (Sapirstein, Terray, and Yennie, 1984). The four principle sources of uncertainty in ��MuðthÞ are ��rad, ��rec, ��r-r, and ��had in Eq. (206). Based on the discussion in CODATA-02, CODATA-06, and the new results above, the current uncertainties from these contributions are 7 Hz, 74 Hz, 63 Hz, and 4 Hz, respectively, for a total of 98 Hz. Since this is only 3% less than the value 101 Hz used in the 2006 adjustment, and in view of the incomplete nature of the calculations, the Task Group has retained the 101 Hz standard uncertainty of that adjustment: u½��MuðthÞ� ¼ 101 Hz ½2:3� 10�8�: (219) For the least-squares calculations, we use as the theoretical expression for the hyperfine splitting ��MuðR1;�;me=m�;��;�MuÞ¼��MuðthÞþ�Mu; (220) where the input datum for the additive correction �Mu, which accounts for the uncertainty of the theoretical expression and is data item B28 in Table XX, is 0(101) Hz. The above theory yields ��Mu¼4463302891ð272ÞHz ½6:1�10�8� (221) using values of the constants obtained from the 2010 adjust- ment without the two LAMPF measured values of ��Mu discussed in the following section. The main source of un- certainty in this value is the mass ratio me=m�. 2. Measurements of muonium transition frequencies and values of ��=�p and m�=me The two most precise determinations of muonium Zeeman transition frequencies were carried out at the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility at Los Alamos (LAMPF), USA, and were reviewed in detail in CODATA-98. The results are as follows. Data reported in 1982 byMariam (1981) and Mariam et al. (1982) are ��Mu¼4463302:88ð16Þ kHz ½3:6�10�8�; (222) �ðfpÞ ¼ 627 994:77ð14Þ kHz ½2:2� 10�7�; (223) r½��Mu; �ðfpÞ� ¼ 0:227; (224) where fp is 57.972 993 MHz, corresponding to the magnetic flux density of about 1.3616 T used in the experiment, and r½��Mu; �ðfpÞ� is the correlation coefficient of ��Mu and �ðfpÞ. The data reported in 1999 by Liu et al. (1999) are ��Mu¼4463302765ð53ÞHz ½1:2�10�8�; (225) �ðfpÞ ¼ 668 223 166ð57Þ Hz ½8:6� 10�8�; (226) r½��Mu; �ðfpÞ� ¼ 0:195; (227) where fp is 72.320 000 MHz, corresponding to the flux density of approximately 1.7 T used in the experiment. The data in Eqs. (222), (223), (225), and (226) are data items B29:1, B30, B29:2, and B31, respectively, in Table XX. The expression for the magnetic-moment ratio is ��þ �p ¼�� 2 Mu��2ðfpÞþ2sefp�ðfpÞ 4sef 2 p�2fp�ðfpÞ � g�þðMuÞ g�þ ��1 ; (228) where ��Mu and �ðfpÞ are the sum and difference of two measured transition frequencies, fp is the free proton NMR reference frequency corresponding to the flux density used in the experiment, g�þðMuÞ=g�þ is the bound-state correction for the muon in muonium given in Table XV, and se ¼ �e� �p ge�ðMuÞ ge� ; (229) where ge�ðMuÞ=ge� is the bound-state correction for the electron in muonium given in the same table. The muon to electron mass ratio m�=me and the muon to proton magnetic-moment ratio ��=�p are related by 1556 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B.

(204) and Eqs. (228)–(230), yields ��þ �p ¼ 3:183 345 24ð37Þ ½1:2� 10�7�; (231) m� me ¼ 206:768 276ð24Þ ½1:2� 10�7�; (232) ��1 ¼ 137:036 0018ð80Þ ½5:8� 10�8�; (233) where this value of ��1 is denoted as ��1ð��MuÞ. The uncertainty ofm�=me in Eq. (232) is nearly 5 times the uncertainty of the 2010 recommended value. In Eq. (232), the value follows from Eqs. (228)–(230) with almost the same uncertainty as the moment ratio in Eq. (231). Taken together, the experimental value of and theoretical expression for the hyperfine splitting essentially determine the value of the product �2me=m�, as is evident from Eq. (204), with an uncertainty dominated by the 2:3� 10�8 relative uncertainty in the theory, and in this limited least-squares adjustment � is otherwise unconstrained. However, in the full adjustment the value of � is determined by other data which in turn deter- mines the value of m�=me with a significantly smaller uncer- tainty than that of Eq. (232). VII. QUOTIENT OF PLANCK CONSTANT AND PARTICLE MASS h=mðXÞ AND � Measurements of h=mðXÞ are of potential importance because the relation R1 ¼ �2mec=2h implies � ¼ � 2R1 c ArðXÞ ArðeÞ h mðXÞ � 1=2 ; (234) where ArðXÞ is the relative atomic mass of particle X with mass mðXÞ and ArðeÞ is the relative atomic mass of the electron. Because c is exactly known, the relative standard uncertainties of R1 and ArðeÞ are 5:0� 10�12 and 4:0� 10�10, respectively, and the uncertainty of ArðXÞ for many particles and atoms is less than that of ArðeÞ, Eq. (234) can provide a competitive value of � if h=mðXÞ is determined with a sufficiently small uncertainty. This section discusses measurements of h=mð133CsÞ and h=mð87RbÞ. A. Quotient h=mð133CsÞ Wicht et al. (2002) determined h=mð133CsÞ by measuring the atomic recoil frequency shift of photons absorbed and emitted by 133Cs atoms using atom interferometry. Carried out at Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA, the experiment is discussed in CODATA-06 and CODATA-02. Consequently, only the final result is given here: h mð133CsÞ¼3:002369432ð46Þ�10 �9 m2 s�1 ½1:5�10�8�: (235) The observational equation for this datum is, from Eq. (234), h mð133CsÞ ¼ ArðeÞ Arð133CsÞ c�2 2R1 : (236) The value of � inferred from this expression and Eq. (235) is given in Table XXV, Sec. XIII. The Stanford result for h=mð133CsÞ was not included as an input datum in the final adjustment on which the 2006 recom- mended values are based because of its low weight, and is omitted from the 2010 final adjustment for the same reason. Nevertheless, it is included as an initial input datum to provide a complete picture of the available data that provide values of �. B. Quotient h=mð87RbÞ A value of h=mð87RbÞ with a relative standard uncertainty of 1:3� 10�8 obtained at LKB in Paris was taken as an input datum in the 2006 adjustment and its uncertainty was suffi- ciently small for it to be included in the 2006 final adjustment. Reported by Cladé et al. (2006) and discussed in CODATA- 06, h=mð87RbÞ was determined by measuring the rubidium recoil velocity vr ¼ ℏk=mð87RbÞ when a rubidium atom absorbs or emits a photon of wave vector k ¼ 2�= , where is the wavelength of the photon and � ¼ c= is its fre- quency. The measurements were based on Bloch oscillations in a moving standing wave. A value of h=mð87RbÞ with a relative uncertainty of 9:2� 10�9 and in agreement with the earlier result, obtained from a new LKB experiment using combined Bloch oscilla- tions and atom interferometry, was subsequently reported by Cadoret et al. (2008a). In this approach Bloch oscillations are employed to transfer a large number of photon momenta to rubidiumatoms and an atom interferometer is used to accurately determine the resulting variation in the velocity of the atoms. Significant improvements incorporated into this version of the experiment have now provided a newer value ofh=mð87RbÞ that not only agrees with the two previous values, but has an uncertainty over 10 and 7 times smaller, respectively. As given by Bouchendira et al. (2011), the new LKB result is h mð87RbÞ ¼ 4:591 359 2729ð57Þ � 10 �9 m2 s�1 ½1:2� 10�9�: (237) Because the LKB researchers informed the Task Group that this result should be viewed as superseding the two earlier results (Biraben, 2011), it is the only value of h=mð87RbÞ included as an input datum in the 2010 adjustment . The observational equation for this datum is, from Eq. (234), h mð87RbÞ ¼ ArðeÞ Arð87RbÞ c�2 2R1 : (238) The value of � inferred from this expression and Eq. (237) is given in Table XXV, Sec. XIII. The experiment of the LKB group from which the result given in Eq. (237) was obtained is described in the paper by Bouchendira et al. (2011) and the references cited therein; see also Cadoret et al. (2008b, 2009, 2011), and Cladé et al. (2010). It is worth noting, however, that the reduction in uncertainty of the 2008 result by over a factor of 7 was achieved by reducing the uncertainties of a number of indi- vidual components, especially those due to the alignment of Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1557 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 beams, wave front curvature and Gouy phase, and the second- order Zeeman effect. The total fractional correction for sys- tematic effects is �53ð12Þ � 10�10 and the statistical or type A uncertainty is 4 parts in 1010. C. Other data A result for the quotient h=mnd220ðW04Þ with a relative standard uncertainty of 4:1� 10�8, where mn is the neutron mass and d220ðW04Þ is the f220g lattice spacing of the crystal WASO 04, was included in the past three CODATA adjust- ments, although its uncertainty was increased by the multi- plicative factor 1.5 in the 2006 final adjustment. It was obtained by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Braunschweig, Germany, researchers working at the ILL high-neutron-flux reactor in Grenoble (Krüger, Nistler, and Weirauch, 1999). Since the result has a relative uncertainty of 4:1� 10�8, the value of � that can be inferred from it, even assuming that d220ðW04Þ is exactly known, has an uncertainty of about 2� 10�8. This is over 50 times larger than that of � from ae and is not competitive. Further, the inferred value dis- agrees with the ae value. On the other hand, the very small uncertainty of the ae value of � means that the PTB result for h=mnd220ðW04Þ can provide an inferred value of d220ðW04Þ with the competitive relative uncertainty of about 4 parts in 108. However, this inferred lattice-spacing value, reflecting the disagreement of the inferred value of alpha, is inconsistent with the directly determined x-ray and optical interferometer (XROI) value. This discrepancy could well be the result of the different effective lattice parameters for the different experiments. In the PTB measurement of h=mnd220ðW04Þ, the de Broglie wavelength, � 0:25 nm, of slow neutrons was determined using back reflection from the surface of a silicon crystal. As pointed out to the Task Group by Peter Becker (2011) of the PTB, the lattice spacings near the surface of the crystal, which play a more critical role than in the XROI measure- ments carried out using x-ray transmission, may be strained and not the same as the spacings in the bulk of the crystal. For these reasons, the Task Group decided not to consider this result for inclusion in the 2010 adjustment. VIII. ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS This section focuses on 18 input data resulting from high- accuracy electrical measurements, 16 of which were also available for the 2006 adjustment. The remaining two became available in the intervening 4 years. Of the 16, 13 were not included in the final adjustment on which the 2006 recom- mended values are based because of their low weight. These same data and one of the two new values are omitted in the final 2010 adjustment for the same reason. Nevertheless, all are initially included as input data because of their usefulness in providing an overall picture of the consistency of the data and in testing the exactness of the Josephson and quantum- Hall-effect relations KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2. As an aid, we begin with a concise overview of the seven different types of electrical quantities of which the 18 input data are particu- lar examples. A. Types of electrical quantities If microwave radiation of frequency f is applied to a Josephson effect device, quantized voltages UJðnÞ ¼ nf=KJ are induced across the device, where n, an integer, is the step number of the voltage and KJ ¼ 2e=h is the Josephson con- stant. Similarly, the quantized Hall resistance of the ith resist- ance plateau of a quantum-Hall-effect device carrying a current and in amagnetic field, i an integer, is given byRHðiÞ ¼ RK=i, where RK ¼ h=e2 ¼ �0c=2� is the von Klitzing con- stant. Thus, measurement ofKJ in its SI unitHz=V determines the quotient 2e=h, and since in the SI c and �0 are exactly known constants, measurement of RK in its SI unit � deter- mines �. Further, since K2JRK ¼ 4=h, a measurement of this product in its SI unit ðJ sÞ�1 determines h. The gyromagnetic ratio �x of a bound particle x of spin quantum number i and magnetic moment �x is given by �x ¼ 2�f B ¼ ! B ¼ j�xj iℏ ; (239) where f is the spin-flip (or precession) frequency and! is the angular precession frequency of the particle in the magnetic flux density B. For a bound and shielded proton p and helion h Eq. (239) gives �0p ¼ 2�0p ℏ ; �0h ¼ 2�0h ℏ ; (240) where the protons are in a spherical sample of pure H2O at 25 �C surrounded by vacuum; and the helions are in a spheri- cal sample of low-pressure, pure 3He gas at 25 �C surrounded by vacuum. The shielded gyromagnetic ratio of a particle can be determined by two methods but the quantities actually measured are different: the low-field method determines �0x=KJRK while the high-field method determines �0xKJRK. In both cases an electric current I is measured using the Josephson and quantum Hall effects with the conventional values of the Josephson and von Klitzing constants. We have for the two methods �0x ¼ �0x�90ðloÞ KJRK KJ�90RK�90 ; (241) �0x ¼ �0x�90ðhiÞ KJ�90RK�90 KJRK ; (242) where �0x�90ðloÞ and �0x�90ðhiÞ are the experimental values of �0x in SI units that would result from low- and hi-field experi- ments, respectively, if KJ and RK had the exactly known conventional values KJ�90 and RK�90. The actual input data used in the adjustment are �0x�90ðloÞ and �0x�90ðhiÞ since these are the quantities actually measured in the experiments, but their observational equations (see Table XXXIII) account for the fact that KJ�90 � KJ and RK�90 � RK. Finally, for the Faraday constant F we have F ¼ F 90 KJ�90RK�90 KJRK ; (243) where F 90 is the actual quantity experimentally measured. Equation (243) is similar to Eq. (242) because F 90 depends on current in the same way as �0x�90ðhiÞ, and the same com- ments apply. 1558 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 B. Electrical data The 18 electrical input data are data items B32:1–B38 in Table XX, Sec. XIII. Data items B37:4 and B37:5, the two new input data mentioned above and which, like the other three data in this category, are moving-coil watt-balance results for the product K2JRK, are discussed in the next two sections. Since the other 16 input data have been discussed in one or more of the three previous CODATA reports, we provide only limited information here. B32:1 and B32:2, labeled NIST-89 and NIM-95, are values of�0p�90ðloÞ obtained at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg,MD,USA (Williams et al., 1989), and at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), Beijing, PRC (Liu et al., 1995), respectively. B33, identified as KR/VN-98, is a similar value of �0h�90ðloÞ obtained at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Taedok Science Town, Republic of Korea, in a collaborative effort with researchers from the Mendeleyev All-Russian Research Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), St. Petersburg, Russian Federation (Shifrin, Khorev et al., 1998; Shifrin, Park et al., 1998; Shifrin et al., 1999; Park et al., 1999). B34:1 and B34:2 are values of �0p�90ðhiÞ from NIM (Liu et al., 1995) and NPL (Kibble and Hunt, 1979), respectively, with identifications NIM-95 and NPL-79. B35:1–B35:5 are five calculable-capacitor determinations of RK from NIST (Jeffery et al., 1997, 1998), the National Metrology Institute (NMI), Lindfield, Australia (Small et al., 1997), NPL (Hartland, Jones, and Legg, 1988), NIM (Zhang et al., 1995), and Laboratoire national de métrologie et d’essais (LNE), Trappes, France (Trapon et al., 2001, 2003), respectively, and are labeled NIST-97, NMI-97, NPL-88, NIM-95, and LNE-01. B36:1 with identification NMI-89 is the mercury elec- trometer result for KJ from NMI (Clothier et al., 1989); and B36:2, labeled PTB-91, is the capacitor voltage balance result for KJ from the PTB (Sienknecht and Funck, 1985, 1986; Funck and Sienknecht, 1991). B37:1–B37:3, with identifications NPL-90, NIST-98, and NIST-07, respectively, are moving-coil watt-balance results for K2JRK from NPL (Kibble, Robinson, and Belliss, 1990) and from NIST (Williams et al., 1998; Steiner et al., 2007). The last electrical input datum, B38 and labeled NIST-80, is the silver dissolution coulometer result for F 90 from NIST (Bower and Davis, 1980). The correlation coefficients of these data, as appropriate, are given in Table XXI, Sec. XIII; the observational equations for the seven different types of electrical data of which the 18 input data are particular examples are given in Table XXXIII in the same section and are B32–B38. Recalling that the relative standard uncertainties of R1, �, �e�=�0p, �0h=� 0 p, and ArðeÞ are significantly smaller that those of the electrical input data, inspection of these equations shows that measured values of �0p�90ðloÞ, �0h�90ðloÞ, �0p�90ðhiÞ, RK, KJ, K2JRK, and F 90 principally determine�,�, h,�, h, h, and h, respectively. 1. K2JRK and h: NPL watt balance We consider here and in the following section the two new watt-balance measurements of K2JRK ¼ 4=h. For reviews of such experiments, see, for example, Eichenberger, Genevès, and Gournay (2009), Stock (2011), and Li et al. (2012). The basic idea is to compare electrical power measured in terms of the Josephson and quantum Hall effects to the equivalent mechanical power measured in the SI unit W ¼ m2 kg s�3. The comparison employs an apparatus now called a moving- coil watt balance, or simply a watt balance, first proposed by Kibble (1975) at NPL. A watt-balance experiment can be described by the simple equation msgv ¼ UI, where I is the current in a circular coil in a radial magnetic flux density B and the force on the coil due to I and B is balanced by the weight msg of a standard of mass ms; and U is the voltage induced across the terminals of the coil when it is moved vertically with a velocity v in the same flux density B. Thus, a watt balance is operated in two different modes: the weighing mode and the velocity mode. The NPL Mark II watt balance and its early history were briefly discussed in CODATA-06, including the initial result obtained with it by Robinson and Kibble (2007). Based on measurements carried out from October 2006 to March 2007 and having a relative standard uncertainty of 66 parts in 109, this result became available only after the closing date of the 2006 adjustment. Moreover, the NPL value of K2JRK was 308 parts in 109 smaller than the NIST-07 value with a relative uncertainty of 36 parts in 109. Significant modifications were subsequently made to the NPL apparatus in order to identify previously unknown sources of error as well as to reduce previously identified sources. The modifications were completed in November 2008, the appara- tus was realigned in December 2008, and measurements and error investigations were continued until June 2009. From then to August 2009 the apparatus was dismantled, packed, and shipped to the National Research Council (NRC), Ottawa, Canada. A lengthy, highly detailed preprint reporting the final Mark II result was provided to the Task Group by I.A. Robinson of NPL prior to the 31 December 2010 closing date of the 2010 adjustment. This paper has now been pub- lished and the reported value is (Robinson, 2012) h¼6:62607123ð133Þ�10�34 Js ½2:0�10�7�: (244) This corresponds to K2JRK¼6:0367597ð12Þ�1033 J�1 s�1 ½2:0�10�7� (245) identified as NPL-12 and which is included as an input datum in the current adjustment, data item B37:4. The NPL final result is based on the initial data obtained from October 2006 to March 2007, data obtained during the first half of 2008, and data obtained during the first half of 2009, the final period.Many variables were investigated to determine their possible influence on the measured values of K2JRK. For example, several mass standards with different masses and fabricated from different materials were used during the course of the data taking. A comparison of the uncertainty budgets for the 2007 data and the 2009 data shows significant reductions in all categories, with the exception of the calibration of the mass standards, resulting in the reduction of the overall uncertainty from 66 parts in 109 to 36 parts in 109. Nevertheless, during the week before the balance was to be dismantled, two previously unrecognized possible systematic Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1559 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 errors in the weighing mode of the experiment came to light. Although there was insufficient time to derive a correction for the effects, Robinson obtained an uncertainty estimate for them. This additional uncertainty component, 197 parts in 109, when combined with the initially estimated overall uncertainty, leads to the 200 parts in 109 final uncertainty in Eqs. (244) and (245). Since the same component applies to the initial Mark II result, its uncertainty is increased from 66 parts in 109 to 208 parts in 109. Finally, there is a slight correlation between the final Mark II value of K2JRK, NPL-12, item B37:4 in Table XX, and its 1990 predecessor, NPL-90, item B37:1 in the same table. Based on the paper by Robinson (2012), the correlation coefficient is 0.0025. 2. K2JRK and h: METAS watt balance The watt-balance experiment at the Federal Office of Metrology (METAS), Bern-Wabern, Switzerland, was initi- ated in 1997, and progress reports describing more than a decade of improvements and investigations of possible sys- tematic errors have been published and presented at confer- ences (Beer et al., 1999, 2001, 2003). A detailed preprint giving the final result of this effort, which is being continued with a new apparatus, was provided to the Task Group by A. Eichenberger of METAS prior to the 31 December 2010 closing date of the 2010 adjustment, and was subsequently published by Eichenberger et al. (2011). The METAS value for h and the corresponding value for K2JRK, identified as METAS-11, input datum B37:5, are h¼6:6260691ð20Þ�10�34 Js ½2:9�10�7�; (246) and K2JRK¼6:0367617ð18Þ�1033 J�1 s�1 ½2:9�10�7�: (247) The METAS watt balance differs in a number of respects from those of NIST and NPL. For example, the METAS apparatus was designed to use a 100 g mass standard and a commercial mass comparator rather than a 1 kg standard and a specially designed and constructed balance in order to reduce the size and complexity of the apparatus. Also, the velocity mode was designed to be completely independent of the weighing mode. The use of two separated measuring systems for the two modes in the same apparatus make it possible to optimize each, but does require the transfer of the coil between the two systems during the course of the mea- surements. Improvements in the apparatus over the last sev- eral years of its operation focused on alignment, control of the coil position, and reducing magnet hysteresis. The METAS result is based on six sets of data acquired in 2010, each containing at least 500 individual measurements which together represent over 3400 hours of operation of the apparatus. The 7� 10�8 relative standard uncertainty of the mean of the means of the six data sets is considered by Eichenberger et al. (2011) to be a measure of the reproduc- ibility of the apparatus. The uncertainty budget from which the 29� 10�8 relative uncertainty of the METAS value of K2JRK is obtained contains nine components, but the domi- nant contributions, totaling 20 parts in 108, are associated with the alignment of the apparatus. Eichenberger et al. (2011) point out that because of the mechanical design of the current METAS watt balance, it is not possible to reduce this source of uncertainty in a significant way. 3. Inferred value of KJ As indicated in CODATA-06, a value of KJ with an uncer- tainty significantly smaller than those of the two directly measured values B36:1 and B36:2 can be obtained without assuming the validity of the relations KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2. Dividing the weighted mean of the five directly mea- sured watt-balance values of K2JRK, B37:1–B37:5, by the weighted mean of the five directly measured calculable- capacitor values of RK, B35:1–B35:5, we have KJ¼KJ�90½1�3:0ð1:9Þ�10�8� ¼483597:8853ð92ÞGHz=V ½1:9�10�8�: (248) This result is consistent with the two directly measured values but has an uncertainty that is smaller by more than an order of magnitude. C. Josephson and quantum-Hall-effect relations The theoretical and experimental evidence accumulated over the past 50 years for the Josephson effect and 30 years for the quantum Hall effect that supports the exactness of the relations KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2 has been discussed in the three previous CODATA reports and references cited therein. The vast majority of the experimental evidence for both effects over the years comes from tests of the universal- ity of these relations; that is, their invariance with experimen- tal variables such as the material of which the Josephson effect and quantum-Hall-effect devices are fabricated. However, in both the 2002 and 2006 adjustments, the input data were used to test these relations experimentally in an ‘‘absolute’’ sense, that is by comparing the values of 2e=h and h=e2 ¼ �0c=2� implied by the data assuming the relations are exact with those implied by the data under the assumption that they are not exact. Indeed, such an analysis is given in this report in Sec. XIII.B.3. Also briefly discussed there is the ‘‘metrology triangle.’’ Here we discuss other developments of interest that have occurred between the closing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjustments. Noteworthy for the Josephson effect is the publication by Wood and Solve (2009) of ‘‘A review of Josephson compari- son results.’’ They examined a vast number of Josephson junction voltage comparisons conducted over the past 30 years involving many different laboratories, junction materials, types of junctions, operating frequencies, step numbers, num- ber of junctions in series, voltage level, and operating tem- perature with some comparisons achieving a precision of a few parts in 1011. They find no evidence that the relation KJ ¼ 2e=h is not universal. There are three noteworthy developments for the quantum Hall effect. First is the recent publication of a C. R. Physique special issue on the quantum Hall effect and metrology with a number of theoretical as well as experimental papers that support the exactness of the relation RK ¼ h=e2; see the Foreword to this issue by Glattli (2011) and the papers 1560 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 contained therein, as well as the recent review article by Weis and von Klitzing (2011). The second is the agreement found between the value of RK in a normal GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure quantum-Hall- effect device and a graphene (two-dimensional graphite) device to within the 8.6 parts in 1011 uncertainty of the experiment (Janssen et al., 2011, 2012). This is an extremely important result in support of the universality of the above relation, because of the significant difference in the charge carriers in graphene and the usual two dimensional semiconductor sys- tems; see Kramer et al. (2010), Peres (2010), and Goerbig (2011). The third is the theoretical paper by Penin (2009). Penin’s calculations appear to show that the relation RK ¼ h=e2 is not exact but should be written as RK ¼ ðh=e2Þ½1þ C�, where the correction C is due to vacuum polarization and is given by C ¼ �ð2=45Þð�=�ÞðB=B0Þ2. Here B is the magnetic flux density applied to the quantum-Hall-effect device and B0 ¼ 2�c2m2e=he � 4:4� 109 T. However, since B is generally no larger than 20 T, the correction, approximately �2� 10�21, is vanishingly small and can be completely ignored. Further, Penin (2009) argues that because of the topological nature of the quantum Hall effect, there can be no other type of correction including finite-size effects. IX. MEASUREMENTS INVOLVING SILICON CRYSTALS Experimental results obtained using nearly perfect single crystals of natural silicon are discussed here, along with a new result for NA with a relative standard uncertainty of 3:0� 10�8 obtained using highly enriched silicon. For this material, xð28SiÞ � 0:999 96, compared to xð28SiÞ � 0:92 for natural silicon, where xðASiÞ is the amount-of-substance fraction of the indicated isotope. The new NA result (see Sec. IX.F) as well as much of the natural silicon data used in the current and previous CODATA adjustments were obtained as part of an extensive interna- tional effort under way since the early 1990s to determine NA with the smallest possible uncertainty. This worldwide enter- prise, which has many participating laboratories and is called the International Avogadro Coordination (IAC), carries out its work under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) of the CIPM. The eight natural silicon crystal samples of interest here are denoted WASO 4.2a, WASO 04, WASO 17, NRLM3, NRLM4, MO*, ILL, and N, and the f220g crystal lattice spacing of each, d220ðXÞ, is taken as an adjusted constant. For simplicity the shortened forms W4.2a, W04, W17, NR3, and NR4 are used in quantity symbols for the first five crystals. Note also that crystal labels actually denote the single crystal ingot from which the crystal samples are taken, since no distinction is made between different samples taken from the same ingot. Silicon is a cubic crystal with n ¼ 8 atoms per face-centered cubic unit cell of edge length (or lattice parameter) a � 543 pm with f220g crystal lattice spacing d220 ¼ a= ffiffiffi 8 p � 192 pm. For practical purposes, it can be assumed that a, and thus d220, of an impurity free, crystallographically perfect or ‘‘ideal’’ silicon crystal at specified conditions of temperature t, pressure p, and isotopic composition is an invariant of nature. The currently adopted reference conditions for natural silicon are t90 ¼ 22:5 �C and p ¼ 0 (vacuum), where t90 is Celsius temperature on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). Reference values for xðASiÞ have not been adopted, because any variation of d220ðXÞ with the typical isotopic composition variation observed for the natural silicon crystals used is deemed negligible. To convert the lattice spacing d220ðXÞ of a real crystal to the lattice spacing d220 of an ideal crystal requires the application of corrections for impurities, mainly carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Typical variation in the lattice spacing of different samples from the same ingot is taken into account by including an additional relative standard uncertainty component of ffiffiffi 2 p � 10�8 for each crystal in the uncertainty budget of any mea- surement result involving one or more silicon lattice spacings. However, the component is ð3=2Þ ffiffiffi 2 p � 10�8 in the case of crystal MO� because it is known to contain a comparatively large amount of carbon. For simplicity, we do not explicitly mention the inclusion of such components in the following discussion. A. Measurements of d220 Xð Þ of natural silicon Measurements of d220ðXÞ are performed using a combined XROI. The interferometer has three lamenae from a single crystal, one of which can be displaced and is called the analyzer; see CODATA-98. Also discussed there is the mea- surement at PTB using an XROI with WASO 4.2a (Becker et al., 1981) This result, which was taken as an input datum in the past three adjustments, is also used in the current adjust- ment; its value is d220ðW4:2aÞ¼192015:563ð12Þ fm ½6:2�10�8�; (249) which is data item B41:1, labeled PTB-81, in Table XX. The three other f220g natural silicon lattice spacings taken as input data in the 2010 adjustment, determined at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica, (INRIM) Torino, Italy, using XROIs fabricated from MO*, WASO 04, and WASO 4.2a, are much more recent results. Ferroglio, Mana, and Massa (2008) report d220ðMO�Þ¼192015:5508ð42Þ fm ½2:2�10�8�; (250) which is data item B39, labeled INRIM-08; Massa et al. (2009) find d220ðWO4Þ¼192015:5702ð29Þ fm ½1:5�10�8�; (251) which is data item B40, labeled INRIM-09; and Massa, Mana, and Kuetgens (2009) give d220ðW4:2aÞ¼192015:5691ð29Þ fm ½1:5�10�8�; (252) which is data item B41:2, labeled INRIM-09. The XROI used to obtain these three results is a new design with many special features. The most significant advance over previous designs is the capability to displace the ana- lyzer by up to 5 cm. In the new apparatus, laser interferome- ters and capacitive transducers sense crystal displacement, parasitic rotations, and transverse motions, and feedback loops provide positioning with picometer resolution, align- ment with nanometer resolution, and movement of the ana- lyzer with nanometer straightness. A number of fractional corrections for different effects, such as laser wavelength, Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1561 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 laser beam diffraction, laser beam alignment, and tempera- ture of the crystal, are applied in each determination; the total correction for each of the three results, in parts in 109, is 6.5, �4:0, and 3.7, respectively. The relative standard uncertain- ties of the three lattice-spacing measurements without the additional uncertainty component for possible variation in the lattice spacing of different samples from the same ingot, again in parts in 109, are 6.1, 5.2, and 5.2. The three INRIM lattice-spacing values are correlated with one another, as well as with the enriched silicon value of NA discussed in Sec. IX.F. The latter correlation arises because the f220g lattice spacing of the enriched silicon was deter- mined at INRIM by Massa, Mana, Kuetgens, and Ferroglio (2011) using the same XROI apparatus (relative standard uncertainty of 3.5 parts in 109 achieved). The relevant corre- lation coefficients for these data are given in Table XXI and are calculated using information provided to the Task Group by Mana (2011). The many successful cross-checks of the performance of the new INRIM combined x-ray and optical interferometer lend support to the reliability of the results obtained with it. Indeed, Massa et al. (2011) describe a highly successful test based on the comparison of the lattice spacings of enriched and natural silicon determined using the new XROI. Consequently, the IAC (Mana, 2011) and the Task Group view the new INRIM values for d220ðMO�Þ and d220ðW04Þ as superseding the earlier INRIM values of these lattice spacings used in the 2006 adjustment. B. d220 difference measurements of natural silicon crystals Measurements of the fractional difference ½d220ðXÞ � d220ðrefÞ�=d220ðrefÞ of the f220g lattice spacing of a sample of a single crystal ingot X and that of a reference crystal ‘‘ref’’ enable the lattice spacings of crystals used in various experiments to be related to one another. Both NIST and PTB have carried out such measurements, and the fractional dif- ferences from these two laboratories that we take as input data in the 2010 adjustment are data items B42–B53 in Table XX, labeled NIST-97, NIST-99, NIST-06, PTB-98, and PTB-03. Their relevant correlation coefficients can be found in Table XXI. For details concerning the NISTand PTB difference measurements, see the three previous CODATA reports. A discussion of item B53, the fractional difference between the f220g lattice spacing of an ideal natural silicon crystal d220 and d220ðW04Þ, is given in CODATA-06 follow- ing Eq. (312). C. Gamma-ray determination of the neutron relative atomic mass ArðnÞ The value of ArðnÞ listed in Table II from AME2003 is not used in the 2010 adjustment. Rather, ArðnÞ is obtained as described here so that the 2010 recommended value is con- sistent with the current data on the f220g lattice spacing of silicon. The value of ArðnÞ is obtained from measurement of the wavelength of the 2.2 MeV � ray in the reaction nþ p ! dþ �. The result obtained from Bragg-angle measurements carried out at the high-flux reactor of ILL in a NIST and ILL collaboration is (Kessler, Jr., et al., 1999) meas d220ðILLÞ ¼0:002 904 302 46ð50Þ ½1:7�10�7�: (253) Here d220ðILLÞ is the f220g lattice spacing of the silicon crystals of the ILL GAMS4 spectrometer at t90 ¼ 22:5 �C and p ¼ 0 used in the measurements. Relativistic kinematics of the reaction yields the observational equation (see CODATA-98) meas d220ðILLÞ ¼ � 2ArðeÞ R1d220ðILLÞ ArðnÞþArðpÞ ½ArðnÞþArðpÞ�2�A2r ðdÞ ; (254) where the quantities on the right-hand side are adjusted constants. D. Historic x-ray units Units used in the past to express the wavelengths of x-ray lines are the copper K�1 x unit, symbol xuðCuK�1Þ, the molybdenum K�1 x unit, symbol xuðMoK�1Þ, and the ång- strom star, symbol �A�. They are defined by assigning an exact, conventional value to the wavelength of the CuK�1, MoK�1, and WK�1 x-ray lines when each is expressed in its corresponding unit: ðCuK�1Þ ¼ 1 537:400 xuðCuK�1Þ; (255) ðMoK�1Þ ¼ 707:831 xuðMoK�1Þ; (256) ðWK�1Þ ¼ 0:209 010 0 �A�: (257) The data relevant to these units are (see CODATA-98) ðCuK�1Þ d220ðW4:2aÞ ¼0:80232711ð24Þ ½3:0�10�7�; (258) ðWK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ¼ 0:108 852 175ð98Þ ½9:0� 10�7�; (259) ðMoK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ¼ 0:369 406 04ð19Þ ½5:3� 10�7�; (260) ðCuK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ¼ 0:802 328 04ð77Þ ½9:6� 10�7�; (261) where d220ðW4:2aÞ and d220ðNÞ denote the f220g lattice spac- ings, at the standard reference conditions p ¼ 0 and t90 ¼ 22:5 �C, of particular silicon crystals used in the measure- ments. The result in Eq. (258) is from a collaboration between researchers from Friedrich-Schiller University (FSUJ), Jena, Germany, and the PTB (Härtwig et al., 1991). To obtain recommended values for xuðCuK�1Þ, xuðMoK�1Þ, and �A�, we take these units to be adjusted constants. The observational equations for the data of Eqs. (258)–(261) are ðCuK�1Þ d220ðW4:2aÞ ¼ 1 537:400 xuðCuK�1Þ d220ðW4:2aÞ ; (262) ðWK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ¼ 0:209 010 0 �A� d220ðNÞ ; (263) 1562 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 ðMoK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ¼ 707:831 xuðMoK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ; (264) ðCuK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ¼ 1 537:400 xuðCuK�1Þ d220ðNÞ ; (265) where d220ðNÞ is taken to be an adjusted constant and d220ðW17Þ and d220ðW4:2aÞ are adjusted constants as well. E. Other data involving natural silicon crystals Two input data used in the 2006 adjustment but not used in the 2010 adjustment at the request of the IAC (Fujii, 2010) are discussed in this section. The first is the f220g lattice spacing d220ðNR3Þ from the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), Tsukuba, Japan, reported by Cavagnero et al. (2004). The IAC for- mally requested that the Task Group not consider this result for the 2010 adjustment, because of its questionable reliabil- ity due to the problems discussed in Sec. VIII.A.1.b of CODATA-06. The second is the molar volume of natural silicon VmðSiÞ from which NA can be determined. The value used in the 2006 adjustment is (Fujii et al., 2005) 12:058 8254ð34Þ � 10�6 m3 mol�1 ½2:8� 10�7�. The IAC requested that the Task Group no longer consider this result, because of prob- lems uncovered with the molar mass measurements of natural silicon MðSiÞ at the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), Geel, Belgium. One problem is associated with the experimental determi- nation of the calibration factors of the mass spectrometer used to measure the amount-of-substance ratios (see the following section) of the silicon isotopes 28Si, 29Si, and 30Si in various silicon crystals, as discussed by Valkiers et al. (2011). The factors are critical, because molar masses are calculated from these ratios and the comparatively well-known relative atomic masses of the isotopes. Another problem is the un- explained large scatter of 7 parts in 107 in molar mass values among crystals taken from the same ingot, as dis- cussed by Fujii et al. (2005) in connection with their result for VmðSiÞ given above. More specifically, from 1994 to 2005 IRMM measured the molar masses of natural silicon in terms of the molar mass of WASO17.2, which was determined using the now suspect calibration factors (Valkiers et al., 2011). Based on a new determination of the calibration factors, Valkiers et al. (2011) report a value for the molar mass of WASO17.2 that has a relative standard uncertainty of 2:4� 10�7, compared to the 1:3� 10�7 uncertainty of the value used since 1994, andwhich is fractionally larger by 1:34� 10�6 than the earlier value. [The recent paper by Yi et al. (2012) also points to a correction of the same general magnitude.] This new result and the data and calculations in Fujii et al. (2005) yield the following revised value for the molar volume of natural silicon: VmðSiÞ¼12:0588416ð45Þ�10�6m3mol�1 ½3:7�10�7�: (266) Although the IAC does not consider this result to be sufficiently reliable for the Task Group to consider it for inclusion in the 2010 adjustment, we note that based on the 2010 recommended values of d220 and the molar Planck constant NAh, Eq. (266) implies NA ¼ 6:022 1456ð23Þ � 1023 mol�1 ½3:8� 10�7�; h ¼ 6:626 0649ð25Þ � 10�34 J s ½3:8� 10�7�: (267) The difference between this value of NA and the value with relative standard uncertainty 3:0� 10�8 obtained from en- riched silicon discussed in the next section is 7.9(3.8) parts in 107, while the difference between the NIST 2007 watt- balance value of h with uncertainty 3:6� 10�8 and this value of h is 6.1(3.8) parts in 107. F. Determination of NA with enriched silicon The IAC project to determine NA using the x ray crystal density (XRCD) method and silicon crystals highly enriched with 28Si was formally initiated in 2004, but its origin dates back two decades earlier. Its initial result is discussed in detail in aMetrologia special issue; see the Foreword by Massa and Nicolaus (2011), the 14 technical papers in the issue, and the references cited therein. The first paper, by Andreas et al. (2011a), provides an extensive overview of the entire project. The value of the Avogadro constant obtained from this unique international collaborative effort, identified as IAC-11, input datum B54, is (Andreas et al., 2011a) NA ¼ 6:022 140 82ð18Þ � 1023 mol�1 ½3:0� 10�8�: (268) Note that this result differs slightly from the somewhat earlier result reported by Andreas et al. (2011b) but is the preferred value (Bettin, 2011). The basic equation for the XRCD determination of NA has been discussed in previous CODATA reports. In brief, NA ¼ ArðSiÞMuffiffiffi 8 p d3220�ðSiÞ ; (269) which would apply to an impurity free, crystallographically perfect, ideal silicon crystal. Here ArðSiÞ is the mean relative atomic mass of the silicon atoms in such a crystal, and �ðSiÞ is the crystal’s macroscopic mass density. (In this section, these quantities, as well as d220, are for isotopically enriched silicon.) Thus, to determine NA from Eq. (269) requires determining the density �ðSiÞ, the f220g lattice spacing d220, and the amount-of-substance ratios R29=28 ¼ nð29SiÞ=nð28SiÞ and R30=28 ¼ nð30SiÞ=nð28SiÞ so that ArðSiÞ can be calculated using the well-known values of ArðASiÞ. Equally important is the characterization of the material properties of the crystals used, for example, impurity content, nonimpurity point defects, dislocations, and microscopic voids must be considered. The international effort to determine the Avogadro con- stant, as described in the Metrologia special issue, involved many tasks including the following: enrichment and poly- crystal growth of silicon in the Russian Federation; growth and purification of a 5 kg single silicon crystal ingot in Germany; measurement of the isotopic composition of the crystals at PTB; measurement of the lattice spacing with the newly developed XROI described above at INRIM; grinding Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1563 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 and polishing of two spheres cut from the ingot to nearly perfect spherical shape at NMI; optical interferometric mea- surement of the diameters of the spheres at PTB and NMIJ; measurement of the masses of the spheres in vacuum at PTB, NMIJ, and BIPM; and characterization of and correction for the effect of the contaminants on the surfaces of the spheres at various laboratories. The uncertainty budget for the IAC value of NA is domi- nated by components associated with determining the vol- umes and the surface properties of the spheres, followed by those related to measuring their lattice spacings and their molar masses. These four components, in parts in 109, are 29, 15, 11, and 8 for the sphere designated AVO28-S5. How this result compares with other data and its role in the 2010 adjustment is discussed in Sec. XIII. X. THERMAL PHYSICAL QUANTITIES Table XVI summarizes the eight results for the thermal physical quantities R, k, and k=h, the molar gas constant, the Boltzmann constant, and the quotient of the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively, that are taken as input data in the 2010 adjustment. They are data items B58:1–B60 in TableXXwith correlation coefficients as given in TableXXI and observational equations as given in Table XXXIII. Values of k that can be inferred from these data are given in Table XXVII and are graphically compared in Fig. 4. The first two results, the NPL 1979 and NIST 1988 values of R, were included in the three previous CODATA adjustments, but the other six became available during the four years between the closing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjustments. (Note that not every result in Table XVI appears in the cited reference. For some, additional digits have been provided to the Task Group to reduce rounding errors; for others, the value of R or k actually determined in the experiment is recovered from the reported result using the relationR ¼ kNA and the value ofNA used by the researchers to obtain that result.) A. Acoustic gas thermometry As discussed in CODATA-98 and the references cited therein, measurement of R by the method of acoustic gas thermometry (AGT) is based on the following expressions for the square of the speed of sound in a real gas of atoms or molecules in thermal equilibrium at thermodynamic tempera- ture T and pressure p and occupying a volume V: c2aðT; pÞ ¼ A0ðTÞ þ A1ðTÞpþ A2ðTÞp2 þ A3ðTÞp3 þ � � � : (270) Here A1ðTÞ is the first acoustic virial coefficient, A2ðTÞ is the second, etc., In the limit p ! 0, this becomes c2aðT; 0Þ ¼ A0ðTÞ ¼ �0RT ArðXÞMu ; (271) where �0 ¼ cp=cV is the ratio of the specific heat capacity of the gas at constant pressure to that at constant volume and is 5=3 for an ideal monotonic gas. The basic experimental approach to determining the speed of sound of a gas, usually argon or helium, is to measure the acoustic resonant frequen- cies of a cavity at or near the triple point of water, TTPW ¼ 273:16 K, and at various pressures and extrapolating top ¼ 0. The cavities are cylindrical of either fixed or variable length, or spherical, but most commonly quasispherical in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid. This shape removes the degeneracy of the microwave resonances used to measure the volume of the resonator in order to calculate c2aðT; pÞ from the measured acoustic frequencies and the corresponding acoustic resonator eigenvalues known from theory. The cavities are formed by carefully joining quasihemispherical cavities. In practice, the determination of R by AGT with a relative standard uncertainty of order 1 part in 106 is complex; the application of numerous corrections is required as well as the investigation of many possible sources of error. For a review of the advances made in AGT in the past 20 years, see Moldover (2009). 1. NPL 1979 and NIST 1988 values of R Both the NPL and NISTexperiments are discussed in detail in CODATA-98. We only note here that the NPLmeasurement used argon in a vertical, variable-path-length, 30 mm inner diameter cylindrical acoustic resonator operated at a fixed frequency, and the displacement of the acoustic reflector that formed the top of the resonator was measured using optical interferometry. The NISTexperiment also used argon, and the volume of the stainless steel spherical acoustic resonator, of approximate inside diameter 180 mm, was determined from TABLE XVI.

Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 the mass of mercury of known density required to fill it. The 1986 CODATA recommended value of R is the NPL result while the 1998, 2002, and 2006 CODATA recommended values are the weighted means of the NPL and NIST results. 2. LNE 2009 and 2011 values of R Pitre et al. (2009) and Pitre (2011) obtained the LNE 2009 result using a copper quasisphere of about 100 mm inner diameter and helium gas. The principal advantage of helium is that its thermophysical properties are well known based on ab initio theoretical calculations; the principal disadvantage is that because of its comparatively low mass, impurities have a larger effect on the speed of sound. This problem is mitigated by passing the helium gas through a liquid helium trap and having a continuous flow of helium through the resonator, thereby reducing the effect of outgassing from the walls of the resonator. In calculating the molar mass of the helium Pitre et al. (2009) assumed that the only remain- ing impurity is 3He and that the ratio of 3He to 4He is less than 1:3� 10�6. The critically important volume of the resonator was determined from measurements of its electromagnetic (EM) resonances together with relevant theory of the eigenvalues. The dimensions of the quasihemispheres were also measured using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The volumes so obtained agreed, but the 17� 10�6 relative standard un- certainty of the CMM determination far exceeded the 0:85� 10�6 relative uncertainty of the EM determination. The principal uncertainty components that contribute to the 2.7 parts in 106 uncertainty of the final result are, in parts in 106, 1.8, 1.0, 1.5, and 0.8 due, respectively, to measurement of the volume of the quasisphere (including various correc- tions), its temperature relative to TTPW, extrapolation of c2aðTTPW; pÞ to p ¼ 0, and the reproducibility of the result, based on two runs using different purities of helium and different acoustic transducers (Pitre, 2011). The 2011 LNE result for R, which has the smallest uncer- tainty of any reported to date, is described in great detail by Pitre et al. (2011). It was obtained using the same quasi- spherical resonator employed in the 2009 experiment, but with argon in place of helium. The reduction in uncertainty by more than a factor of 2 was achieved by improving all aspects of the experiment (Pitre et al., 2011). The volume of the resonator was again determined from measurements of its EM resonances and cross checked with CMM dimensional measurements of the quasispheres carried out at NPL (de Podesta et al., 2010). As usual in AGT, the square of the speed of sound was determined from measurements of the quasisphere’s acoustic resonant frequencies at different pres- sures (50 kPa to 700 kPa in this case) and extrapolation to p ¼ 0. The isotopic composition of the argon and its impurity content was determined at IRMM (Valkiers et al., 2010). The five uncertainty components of the final 1.24 parts in 106 uncertainty of the result, with each component itself being composed of a number of subcomponents, are, in parts in 106, the following: 0.30 from temperature measurements (the nominal temperature of the quasisphere was TTPW), 0.57 from the EM measurement of the quasisphere’s volume, 0.84 from the determination of c2aðTTPW; 0Þ, 0.60 associated with the argon molar mass and its impurities, and 0.25 for experimental repeatability based on the results from two series of measurements carried out in May and July of 2009. Because the LNE 2009 and 2011 results are from experi- ments in which some of the equipment and measuring tech- niques are the same or similar, they are correlated. Indeed, for the same reason, there are non-negligible correlations among the four recent AGT determinations of R, that is, LNE-09, NPL-10, INRIM-10, and LNE-11. These correlations are given in Table XXI and have been calculated using informa- tion provided to the Task Group by researchers involved in the experiments (Gavioso, de Podesta, and Pitre, 2011). 3. NPL 2010 value of R This result was obtained at NPL by Sutton et al. (2010) and de Podesta (2011) at TTPW using a thin-walled copper quasispherical resonator of about 100 mm inner diameter on loan from LNE and argon as the working gas. The internal surfaces of the quasihemispheres were machined using dia- mond turning techniques. The 5 mm wall thickness of the quasisphere, about one-half that of the usual AGT resonators, was specially chosen to allow improved study of the effect of resonator shell vibrations on acoustic resonances. The volume of the quasisphere was determined from measurements of EM resonances and checked with CMM dimensional measure- ments of the quasihemispheres before assembly (de Podesta et al., 2010). Two series of measurements were carried out, each lasting several days: one with the quasisphere rigidly attached to a fixed stainless steel post and one with it freely suspended by three wires attached to its equator. Pressures ranged from 50 kPa to 650 kPa and were measured with commercial pressure meters. The isotopic composition of the argon and its impurity content were again determined at IRMM (Valkiers et al., 2010). The final result is the average of the value obtained from each run. The 3.78 parts in 106 difference between the molar mass of the argon used in the fixed and hanging quasisphere runs is to a large extent canceled by the �2:77 parts in 106 difference between the values of c2aðTTPW; 0Þ for the two runs, so the two values of R agree within 1.01 parts in 106. The largest uncertainty components in parts in 106 contributing to the final uncertainty of 3.1 parts in 106 are, respectively (de Podesta et al., 2010; Sutton et al., 2010), 2, 1.1, 0.9, 1, and 1.4 arising from the difference between the acoustic and microwave volumes of the resonator, temperature calibration, temperature measurement, argon gas impurities, and correc- tion for the layer of gas near the wall of the resonator (thermal boundary layer correction). 4. INRIM 2010 value of R The INRIM determination of R by Gavioso et al. (2010) and Gavioso (2011) employed a stainless steel spherical resonator of about 182 mm inner diameter and nonflowing helium gas. Although the measurements were performed with the resonator very near TTPW as in the other AGT molar-gas- constant determinations, two important aspects of the INRIM experiment are quite different. First, the speed of sound was measured at only one pressure, namely, 410 kPa, and the extrapolation to p ¼ 0 was implemented using the compara- tively well-known theoretical values of the required 4He equation-of-state and acoustic virial coefficients. Second, Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1565 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 the radius of the resonator was determined using the theo- retical value of the 4He index of refraction together with eight measured EM resonance frequencies and the corresponding predicted eigenvalues. The speed of sound was then calcu- lated from this value of the radius and measured acoustic resonant frequencies. Gavioso et al. (2010) calculated the molar mass of their He sample assuming the known atmos- pheric abundance of 3He represents an upper limit. The two uncertainty components that are by far the largest contributors to the 7.5 parts in 106 final uncertainty of the experiment are, in parts in 106, 4.2 from fitting the shape of the eight measured microwave modes and 4.8 from the scatter of the squared frequencies of the six measured radial acoustic modes used to determine c2aðTTPW; p ¼ 410 kPaÞ. B. Boltzmann constant k and quotient k=h The following two sections discuss the two NIST experi- ments that have yielded the last two entries of Table XVI. 1. NIST 2007 value of k This result was obtained by Schmidt et al. (2007) using the technique of refractive index gas thermometry (RIGT), an approach similar to that of dielectric constant gas thermom- etry (DCGT) discussed in CODATA-98, and to a lesser extent in CODATA-02 and CODATA-06. The starting point of both DCGT and RIGT is the virial expansion of the equation of state for a real gas of amount of substance n in a volume V (Schmidt et al., 2007), p¼�RT½1þ�bðTÞþ�2cðTÞþ�3dðTÞþ����; (272) where � ¼ n=V is the amount-of-substance density of the gas at thermodynamic temperature T, and bðTÞ is the first virial coefficient, cðTÞ is the second, etc.; and the Clausius-Mossotti equation �r�1 �rþ2 ¼�A�½1þ�B�ðTÞþ�2C�ðTÞþ�3D�ðTÞþ����; (273) where �r ¼ �=�0 is the relative dielectric constant (relative permittivity) of the gas, � is its dielectric constant, �0 is the exactly known electric constant, A� is the molar polarizability of the atoms, and B�ðTÞ, C�ðTÞ, etc., are the dielectric virial coefficients. The static electric polarizability of a gas atom �0, and A�, R, and k are related by A�=R ¼ �0=3�0k, which shows that if �0 is known sufficiently well from theory, which it currently is for 4He (Łach, Jeziorski, and Szalewicz, 2004; Jentschura, Puchalski, and Mohr, 2011; Puchalski, Jentschura, and Mohr, 2011), then a competitive value of k can be obtained if the quotient A�=R can be measured with a sufficiently small uncertainty. In fact, by appropriately combining Eqs. (272) and (273), an expression is obtained from which A�=R can be experi- mentally determined by measuring �r at a known constant temperature such as TTPW and at different pressures and extrapolating to zero pressure. This is done in practice by measuring the fractional change in capacitance of a specially constructed capacitor, first without helium gas and then with helium gas at a known pressure. This is the DCGT technique. In the RIGT technique of Schmidt et al. (2007), A�=R is determined, and hence k, from measurements of n2ðT; pÞ � �r�r of a gas of helium, where nðT; pÞ is the index of refraction of the gas, �r ¼ �=�0 is the relative magnetic permeability of the gas, � is its magnetic permeability, and �0 is the exactly known magnetic constant. Because 4He is slightly diamagnetic, the quantity actually determined is ðA� þ A�Þ=R, where A� ¼ 4��0=3 and �0 is the diamag- netic susceptibility of a 4He atom. The latter quantity is known from theory and the theoretical value of A� was used to obtain A�=R from the determined quantity. Schmidt et al. (2007) obtained nðT; pÞ by measuring the microwave resonant frequencies from 2.7 GHz to 7.6 GHz of a quasispherical copper plated resonator, either evacuated or filled with He at pressures of 0.1 MPa to 6.3 MPa. The temperature of the resonator was within a few millikelvin of TTPW. A network analyzer was used to measure the reso- nant frequencies and a calibrated pressure balance to measure p. The extrapolation to p ¼ 0 employed both theoretical and experimental values of the virial coefficients B, C,D, b, and c taken from the literature. The uncertainties of these coeffi- cients and of the pressure and temperature measurements, and the uncertainty of the isothermal compressibility of the reso- nator, are the largest components in the uncertainty budget. 2. NIST 2011 value of k=h As discussed in CODATA-98, the Nyquist theorem pre- dicts, with a fractional error of less than 1 part in 106 at frequencies less than 10 MHz and temperatures greater than 250 K, that hU2i ¼ 4kTRs�f: (274) Here hU2i is the mean square voltage, or Johnson noise voltage, in a measurement bandwidth of frequency �f across the terminals of a resistor of resistance Rs in thermal equi- librium at thermodynamic temperature T. If hU2i is measured in terms of the Josephson constant KJ ¼ 2e=h and Rs in terms of the von Klitzing constant RK ¼ h=e2, then this experiment yields a value of k=h. Such an experiment has been carried out at NIST, yielding the result in Table XVI; see the paper by Benz et al. (2011) and references therein. In that work, digitally synthesized pseu- donoise voltages are generated by means of a pulse-biased Josephson junction array. These known voltages are compared to the unknown thermal-noise voltages generated by a spe- cially designed 100 � resistor in a well regulated thermal cell at or near TTPW. Since the spectral density of the noise voltage of a 100 � resistor at 273.16 K is only 1:23 nV ffiffiffiffiffiffi Hz p , it is measured using a low-noise, two-channel, cross-correlation technique that enables the resistor signal to be extracted from uncorrelated amplifier noise of comparable amplitude and spectral density. The bandwidths range from 10 kHz to 650 kHz. The final result is based on two data runs, each of about 117 hour duration, separated in time by about three months. The dominant uncertainty component of the 12.1 parts in 106 total uncertainty is the 12.0 parts in 106 component due to the measurement of the ratio hV2R=V2Qi, whereVR is the resistor noise voltage and VQ is the synthesized voltage. The main uncertainty component contributing to the uncertainty of the 1566 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 ratio is 10.4 parts in 106 due to spectral aberrations, that is, effects that lead to variations of the ratio with bandwidth. C. Other data We note for completeness the following three results, each of which agrees with its corresponding 2010 recommended value. The first has a noncompetitive uncertainty but is of interest because it is obtained from a relatively new method that could yield a value with a competitive uncertainty in the future. The other two became available only after the 31 December 2010 closing date of the 2010 adjustment. Lemarchand et al. (2011) find R¼8:31480ð42ÞJm�1K�1 [50�10�6] determined by the method of Doppler spectros- copy, in particular, by measuring near the ice point T ¼ 273:15 K the absorption profile of a rovibrational line at � ¼ 30 THz of ammonia molecules in an ammonium gas in thermal equilibrium. The width of the line is mainly deter- mined by the Doppler width due to the velocity distribution of the 4NH3 molecules along the direction of the incident laser beam. The relevant expression is �!D !0 ¼ � 2kT mð4NH3Þc2 � 1=2 ¼ � 2RT Arð4NH3ÞMuc2 � 1=2 ; (275) where �!D is the e-fold angular frequency half-width of the Doppler profile of the ammonium line at temperature T,!0 is its angular frequency, and mð4NH3Þ and Arð4NH3Þ are the mass and relative atomic mass of the ammonium molecule. Zhang (2011) and Zhang et al. (2011) obtain R ¼ 8:314 474ð66Þ Jmol�1 K�1 ½7:9� 10�6� using acoustic gas thermometry with argon gas, more specifically, by measuring resonant frequencies of a fixed-path-length cylindrical acous- tic resonator at TTPW; its approximate 129 mm length is measured by two-color optical interferometry. Fellmuth et al. (2011) and Gaiser and Fellmuth (2012) give k ¼ 1:380 655ð11Þ � 10�23 J=K ½7:9� 10�6� measured using dielectric gas thermometry (see Sec. X.B.1) and helium gas at TTPW and also at temperatures in the range 21 K to 27 K surrounding the triple point of neon at T � 25 K. D. Stefan-Boltzmann constant � The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is related to c, h, and k by � ¼ 2�5k4=15h3c2, which, with the aid of the relations k¼ R=NA andNAh¼cArðeÞMu�2=2R1, can be expressed in terms of the molar gas constant and other adjusted constants as � ¼ 32� 5h 15c6 � R1R ArðeÞMu�2 � 4 : (276) Since no competitive directly measured value of� is available for the 2010 adjustment, the 2010 recommended value is obtained from this equation. XI. NEWTONIAN CONSTANT OF GRAVITATION G Table XVII summarizes the 11 values of the Newtonian constant of gravitation G of interest in the 2010 adjustment. Because they are independent of the other data relevant to the current adjustment, and because there is no known quantita- tive theoretical relationship betweenG and other fundamental constants, they contribute only to the determination of the 2010 recommended value of G. The calculation of this value is discussed in Sec. XIII.B.1. The inconsistencies between different measurements of G as discussed in the reports of previous CODATA adjustments demonstrate the historic difficulty of determining this most important constant. Unfortunately, this difficulty has been demonstrated anew with the publication of two new competi- tive results for G during the past four years. The first is an improved value from the group at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), PRC, identified as HUST-09 (Luo et al., 2009; Tu et al., 2010); the second is a completely new value from researchers at JILA, Boulder, Colorado,USA, identified as JILA-10 (Parks and Faller, 2010). The publication of the JILA value has led the Task Group to reexamine and modify two earlier results. The first is that obtained at NIST (then known as the National Bureau of Standards) by Luther and Towler (1982) in a NIST-University of Virginia (UVa) collaboration, labeled NIST-82.

Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1567 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 was the basis for the CODATA 1986 recommended value (Cohen and Taylor, 1987) and was taken into account in determining the CODATA 1998 value (Mohr and Taylor, 2000), but played no role in either the 2002 or 2006 adjust- ments. The second is the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, USA, result of Bagley and Luther (1997), labeled LANL-97; it was first included in the 1998 CODATA adjustment and in all subsequent adjustments. The 11 available values of G, which are data items G1–G11 in Table XXIV, Sec. XIII, are the same as in 2006 with the exception of NIST-82, slightly modified LANL-97, and the two new values. Thus, in keeping with our approach in this report, there is no discussion of the other seven values since they have been covered in one or more of the previous reports. For simplicity we write G as a numerical factor multi- plying G0, where G0 ¼ 10�11 m3 kg�1 s�2: (277) A. Updated values 1. National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Virginia As discussed in CODATA-98, the experiment of Luther and Towler (1982) used a fiber-based torsion balance oper- ated in the dynamic mode and the time-of-swing method, thereby requiring measurement of a small change in the long oscillation period of the balance. Ideally, the torsional spring constant of the fiber should be independent of frequency at very low frequencies, for example, at 3 mHz. Long after the publication of the NIST-UVa result, Kuroda (1995) [see also Matsumura et al. (1998) and Kuroda (1999)] pointed out that the anelasticity of such fibers is sufficiently large to cause the value of G determined in this way to be biased. IfQ is the quality factor of the main torsional mode of the fiber and it is assumed that the damping of the torsion balance is solely due to the losses in the fiber, then the unbiased value of G is related to the experimentally observed value GðobsÞ by (Kuroda, 1995) G ¼ GðobsÞ 1þ �Q : (278) Although the exact value of the Q of the fiber used in the NIST-UVa experiment is unknown, Luther (2010) provided an estimate, based on data obtained during the course of the experiment, of no less than 10 000 and no greater than 30 000. Assuming a rectangular probability density function for Q with these lower and upper limits then leads to Q ¼ 2� 104 with a relative standard uncertainty of 4:6�10�6. Using these values, the result GðobsÞ¼6:67259ð43ÞG0 ½64� 10�6� (Luther and Towler, 1982; Luther, 1986), and Eq. (278) we obtain G ¼ 6:672 48ð43ÞG0 ½6:4� 10�5�: (279) In this case the correction 1=ð1þ �QÞ reduced GðobsÞ by the fractional amount 15:9ð4:6Þ � 10�6, but increased its 64� 10�6 relative standard uncertainty by a negligible amount. The Task Group decided to include the value given in Eq. (279) as an input datum in the 2010 adjustment even though it was not included in the 2002 and 2006 adjustments, because information provided by Luther (2010) allows the original result to be corrected for the Kuroda effect. Further, although there were plans to continue the NIST-UVa experi- ment (Luther and Towler, 1982), recent conversations with Luther (2010) made clear that the measurements on which the result is based were thorough and complete. 2. Los Alamos National Laboratory The experiment of Bagley and Luther (1997), also de- scribed in detail in CODATA-98, is similar to the NIST-UVa experiment of Luther and Towler (1982), and in fact used some of the same components including the tungsten source masses. Its purpose was not only to determine G, but also to test the Kuroda hypothesis by using two different fibers, one with Q ¼ 950 and the other with Q ¼ 490. Because the value of G resulting from this experiment is correlated with the NIST-UVa value and both values are now being included in the adjustment, we evaluated the correlation coefficient of the two results. This was done with information from Bagley (2010) and Luther (2010) and Bagley (1996). We also recal- culated the result of the experiment of Bagley and Luther (1997) by taking into account the uncertainties of the two Q values (2%) and the correlation coefficient of the two values of G obtained from the two fibers (0.147) when computing their weighted mean. The final value is G ¼ 6:673 98ð70ÞG0 ½1:0� 10�4�; (280) which in fact is essentially the same as the value used in the 2002 and 2006 adjustments. The correlation coefficient of the NIST-UVa and LANL values of G is 0.351. B. New values 1. Huazhong University of Science and Technology The improved HUST-09 result for G was first reported by Luo et al. (2009) and subsequently described in detail by Tu et al. (2010); it represents a reduction in uncertainty, com- pared to the previous Huazhong University result HUST-05, of about a factor of 5. As pointed out by Tu et al. (2010), a number of changes in the earlier experiment contributed to this uncertainty reduction, including (i) replacement of the two stainless steel cylindrical source masses by spherical source masses with a more homogeneous density; (ii) use of a rectangular quartz block as the principal portion of the torsion balance’s pendulum, thereby improving the stability of the period of the balance and reducing the uncertainty of the pendulum’s moment of inertia; (iii) a single vacuum chamber for the source masses and pendulum leading to a reduction of the uncertainty of their relative positions; (iv) a remotely operated stepper motor to change the positions of the source masses, thereby reducing environmental changes; and (v) measurement of the anelasticity of the torsion fiber with the aid of a high-Q quartz fiber. The final result is the average of two values of G that differ by 9 parts in 106 obtained from two partially correlated determinations using the same apparatus. The dominant com- ponents of uncertainty, in parts in 106, are 19 from the measurement of the fiber’s anelasticity, 14 (statistical) from the measurement of the change in the square of the angular frequency of the pendulum when the source masses are in 1568 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 their near and far positions, and 10 from themeasured distance between the geometric centers of the source masses. Although the uncertainty of HUST-05 is 5 times larger than that of HUST-09, Luo (2010) and co-workers do not believe that HUST-09 supersedes HUST-05. Thus, both are considered for inclusion in the 2010 adjustment. Based on information provided to the Task Group by the researchers (Luo, 2010), their correlation coefficient is estimated to be 0.234 and is used in the calculations of Sec. XIII. The extra digits for the value and uncertainty of HUST-05 were also provided by Luo (2011). 2. JILA As can be seen from Table XVII, the 21� 10�6 relative standard uncertainty of the value of G identified as JILA-10 and obtained at JILA by Parks and Faller (2010) has the third smallest estimated uncertainty of the values listed and is the second smallest of those values. It differs from the value with the smallest uncertainty, identified as UWash-00, by 287(25) parts in 106, which is 11 times the standard uncertainty of their difference udiff , or 11�. This disagreement is an example of the ‘‘historic difficulty’’ referred to at the very beginning of this section. The data on which the JILA researchers based their result were taken in 2004, but being well aware of this incon- sistency they hesitated to publish it until they checked and rechecked their work (Parks and Faller, 2010). With this done, they decided it was time to report their value for G. The apparatus used in the JILA experiment of Parks and Faller (2010) consisted of two 780 g copper test masses (or ‘‘pendulum bobs’’) separated by 34 cm, each of which was suspended from a supporting bar by four wires and together they formed a Fabry-Perot cavity. When the four 120 kg cylindrical tungsten source masses, two pairs with each mem- ber of the pair on either side of the laser beam traversing the cavity, were periodicallymoved parallel to the laser beam from their inner and outer positions (they remained stationary for 80 s in each position), the separation between the bobs changed by about 90 nm. This change was observed as a 125 MHz beat frequency between the laser locked to the pendulum cavity and the laser locked to a reference cavity that was part of the supporting bar. The geometry of the experiment reduces the most difficult aspect of determining the gravitational field of the source masses to six one dimensional measurements: the distance between opposite source mass pairs in the inner and outer positions and the distances between adjacent source masses in the inner position. The most important relative standard uncertainty components contributing to the uncer- tainty ofG are, in parts in 106 (Parks and Faller, 2010), the six critical dimension measurements, 14; all other dimension measurements and source mass density inhomogeneities, 8 each; pendulum spring constants, 7; and total mass measure- ment and interferometer misalignment, 6 each. XII. ELECTROWEAK QUANTITIES As in previous adjustments, there are a few cases in the 2010 adjustment where an inexact constant that is used in the analysis of input data is not treated as an adjusted quantity, because the adjustment has a negligible effect on its value. Three such constants, used in the calculation of the theoretical expression for the electron magnetic-moment anomaly ae, are the mass of the tau lepton m�, the Fermi coupling constant GF, and sine squared of the weak mixing angle sin2�W; they are obtained from the most recent report of the Particle Data Group (Nakamura et al., 2010): m�c 2 ¼ 1776:82ð16Þ MeV ½9:0� 10�5�; (281) GF=ðℏcÞ3 ¼ 1:166364ð5Þ�10�5 GeV�2 ½4:3�10�6�; (282) sin2�W ¼ 0:2223ð21Þ ½9:5� 10�3�: (283) The value for GF=ðℏcÞ3 is from Nakamura et al. (2010), p. 127. We use the definition sin2�W ¼ 1� ðmW=mZÞ2, where mW and mZ are, respectively, the masses of the W and Z0 bosons, because it is employed in the calculation of the electroweak contributions to ae (Czarnecki, Krause, and Marciano, 1996). The Particle Data Group’s recommended value for the mass ratio of these bosons is mW=mZ ¼ 0:8819ð12Þ, which leads to the value of sin2�W given above. XIII. ANALYSIS OF DATA We examine in this section the input data discussed in the previous sections and, based upon that examination, select the data to be used in the least-squares adjustment that deter- mines the 2010 CODATA recommended values of the constants. Tables XVIII, XX, XXII, and XXIV give the input data, including the �’s, which are corrections added to theo- retical expressions to account for the uncertainties of those expressions. The covariances of the data are given as corre- lation coefficients in Tables XIX, XXI, XXIII, and XXIV. There are 14 types of input data for which there are two or more experiments, and the data of the same type generally agree (values of G excepted). A. Comparison of data through inferred values of �, h, k, and ArðeÞ Here the level of consistency of the data is shown by comparing values of �, h, k, and ArðeÞ that can be inferred from different types of experiments. Note, however, that the inferred value is for comparison purposes only; the datum from which it is obtained, not the inferred value, is used as the input datum in the least-squares calculations. Table XXVand Figs. 1 and 2 compare values of � obtained from the indicated input data. These values are calculated using the appropriate observational equation for each input datum as given in Table XXXIII and the 2010 recommended values of the constants other than � that enter that equation. (Some inferred values have also been given where the rele- vant datum is discussed.) Inspection of the table and figures shows that there is agreement among the vast majority of the various values of �, and hence the data from which they are obtained, to the extent that the difference between any two values of � is less than 2udiff , the standard uncertainty of the difference. The two exceptions are the values of � from the NIST-89 result for �0p�90ðloÞ and, to a lesser extent, the KR/VN-98 result for �0h�90ðloÞ; of the 91 differences, six involving � Peter J.

Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 from NIST-89 and two involving � from KR/VN-98 are greater than 2udiff . The inconsistency of these data has in fact been discussed in previous CODATA reports but, as in 2006, because their self-sensitivity coefficients Sc (see Sec. XIII.B) are less than 0.01, they are not included in the final adjustment on which the 2010 recommended values are based. Hence, their disagreement is not a serious issue. Examination of the table and figures also shows that even if all of the data from which these values of � have been inferred were to be included in the final adjustment, the recommended value of � would still be determined mainly by the HarvU-08 ae and LKB-10 h=mð87RbÞ data. Indeed, the comparatively large uncertainties of some of the values of � means that the data from which they are obtained will have values of Sc < 0:01 and will not be included in the final adjustment. Table XXVI and Fig. 3 compare values of h obtained from the indicated input data. The various values of h, and hence the data fromwhich they are calculated, agree to the extent that the 55 differences between any two values of h is less than 2udiff , except for the difference between the NIST-07 and IAC-11 values. In this case, the difference is 3:8udiff . Because the uncertainties of these two values of h are comparable and are smaller than the other values of h, they play the dominant role in the determination of the recommended value of h. This discrepancy is dealt with before carrying out the final adjustment. The relatively large uncer- tainties of many of the other values of h means that the data from which they are calculated will not be included in the final adjustment. Table XXVII and Fig. 4 compare values of k obtained from the indicated input data. Although most of the source data are values of R, values of k ¼ R=NA are compared, because that is the constant used to define the kelvin in the ‘‘new’’ SI; see, for example, Mills et al. (2011). All of these values are in general agreement, with none of the 28 differences exceeding 2udiff . However, some of the input data from which they are calculated have uncertainties so large that they will not be included in the final adjustment. Finally, in Table XXVIII and Fig. 5 we compare four values of ArðeÞ calculated from different input data as indicated. They are in agreement, with all six differences less than 2udiff . Further, since the four uncertainties are comparable, all four of the source data are included in the final adjustment. B. Multivariate analysis of data Our multivariate analysis of the data employs a well- known least-squares method that takes correlations among TABLE XIX.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 and normalized residual of the ith input datum ri ¼ ðxi � hxiiÞ=ui, where xi is the input datum, hxii its adjusted value, and ui its standard uncertainty. The observational equations for the input data are given in Tables XXXI, XXXIII, and XXXV. These equations are written in terms of a particular independent subset of con- stants (broadly interpreted) called, as already noted, adjusted constants. These are the variables (or unknowns) of the adjustment. The least-squares calculation yields values of the adjusted constants that predict values of the input data through their observational equations that best agree with the data themselves in the least-squares sense. The adjusted constants used in the 2010 calculations are given in Tables XXX, XXXII, and XXXIV. The symbol ¼: in an observational equation indicates that an input datum of the type on the left-hand side is ideally given by the expression on the right-hand side containing adjusted constants. But because the equation is one of an overdetermined set that relates a datum to adjusted constants, the two sides are not necessarily equal. The best estimate of the value of an input datum is its observational equation evaluated with the least-squares adjusted values of the ad- justed constants on which its observational equation depends. For some input data such as �e and R, the observational equation is simply �e ¼ : �e and R ¼ : R. The binding energies EbðXÞ=muc2 in the observational equations of Table XXXIII are treated as fixed quantities with negligible uncertainties, as are the bound-state g-factor ratios. The frequency fp is not an adjusted constant but is included in the equation for data items B30 and B31 to indicate that they are functions of fp. Finally, the observa- tional equations for items B30 and B31, which are based on Eqs. (228)–(230) of Sec. VI.B.2, include the function aeð�; �eÞ, as well as the theoretical expression for input data of type B29, ��Mu. The latter expression is discussed in Sec. VI.B.1 and is a function of R1, �, me=m�, and a�. The self-sensitivity coefficient Sc for an input datum is a measure of the influence of a particular item of data on its corresponding adjusted value. As in previous adjustments, in general, for an input datum to be included in the final adjust- ment on which the 2010 recommended values are based, its value of Sc must be greater than 0.01, or 1%, which means that its uncertainty must be no more than about a factor of 10 larger than the uncertainty of the adjusted value of that quantity; see Sec. I.D of CODATA-98 for the justification of this 1% cutoff. However, the exclusion of a datum is not followed if, for example, a datum with Sc < 0:01 is part of a group of data obtained in a given experiment, or series of experiments, where most of the other data have self- sensitivity coefficients greater than 0.01.

In summary, there is one major discrepancy among the data discussed so far: the disagreement of the NIST-07 watt balance value of K2JRK and the IAC-11 enriched 28Si XRCD value of NA, items B37:3 and B54 of Table XX. 1. Data related to the Newtonian constant of gravitation G Our least-squares analysis of the input data begins with the 11 values ofG in TableXXIV,which are graphically compared in Fig. 6. (Because theG data are independent of all other data, they can be treated separately.) As discussed in Secs.

Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . 1575 Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 It is clear from both the table and figure that the data are highly inconsistent. Of the 55 differences among the 11 values, the three largest, 11:4udiff , 10:7udiff , and 10:2udiff , are between JILA-10 and three others: UWash-00, BIPM-01, and UZur-06, respectively. Further, eight range from 4udiff to 7udiff . The weighted mean of the 11 values has a relative standard uncer- tainty of 8:6� 10�6. For this calculation, with � ¼ 10, we have �2 ¼ 209:6, pð209:6j10Þ � 0, and RB ¼ 4:58. Five data have normalized residuals jrij> 2:0: JILA-10, BIPM-01, UWash-00, NIST-82, and UZur-06; their respective values are �10:8, 6.4, 4.4, �3:2 and 3.2. Repeating the calculation using only the six values of G with relative uncertainties 4:0� 10�5, namely, UWash-00, BIPM-01, MSL-03, UZur-06, HUST-09, and JILA-10, has little impact: the value of G increases by the fractional amount 5:0� 10�6 and the relative uncertainty increases to 8:8� 10�6; for this calculation � ¼ 5, �2 ¼ 191:4, pð191:4j5Þ � 0, and RB ¼ 6:19; the values of ri are 4.0, 6.3, �0:05, 3.0, �2:2, and �11:0, respectively. Taking into account the historic difficulty in measuring G and the fact that all 11 values of G have no apparent issue besides the disagreement among them, the Task Group de- cided to take as the 2010 recommended value the weighted mean of the 11 values in Table XXIV after each of their uncertainties is multiplied by the factor 14. This yields G¼6:67384ð80Þ�10�11 m3kg�1 s�2 ½1:2�10�4�: (284) The largest normalized residual, that of JILA-10, is now �0:77, and the largest difference between values of G, that between JILA-10 and UWash-00, is 0:82udiff . For the calcu- lation yielding the recommended value, � ¼ 10, �2 ¼ 1:07, pð1:07j10Þ ¼ 1:00, and RB ¼ 0:33. In view of the significant scatter of the measured values of G, the factor of 14 was chosen so that the smallest and largest values would differ from the recommended value by about twice its uncertainty; see Fig. 6.

Data related to all other constants Tables XXXVI, XXXVII, and XXXVIII summarize 12 least-squares analyses, discussed in the following paragraphs, of the input data and correlation coefficients in Tables XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, and XXIII. Because the adjusted value of R1 is essentially the same for all five adjustments sum- marized in Table XXXVI and equal to that of adjustment 3 of Table XXXVIII, the values are not listed in Table XXXVI. (Note that adjustment 3 in Tables XXXVI and XXXVIII is the same adjustment.) Adjustment 1: The initial adjustment includes all of the input data, three of which have normalized residuals whose absolute magnitudes are problematically greater than 2; see Table XXXVII. They are the 2007 NIST watt-balance result for K2JRK, the 2011 IAC enriched silicon XRCD result for NA, and the 1989 NIST result for � 0 p�90ðloÞ. All other input data have values of jrij less than 2, except those for two antiprotonic 3He transitions, data items C25 and C27 in Table XXII, for which r25 ¼ 2:12 and r27 ¼ 2:10. However, the fact that their normalized residuals are somewhat greater than 2 is not a major concern, because their self-sensitivity coefficients Sc are considerably less than 0.01. In this regard, we see from Table XXXVII that two of the three inconsistent data have values of Sc considerably larger than 0.01; the exception is �0p�90ðloÞ with Sc ¼ 0:0096, which is rounded to 0.010 in the table. Adjustment 2: The difference in the IAC-11 and NIST-07 values of h (see the first two lines of Table XXVI) is 3:8udiff , where as before udiff is the standard uncertainty of the difference. To reduce the difference between these two highly credible results to an acceptable level, that is, to 2udiff or slightly below, the Task Group decided that the uncertainties used in the adjustment for these data would be those in Table XX multiplied by a factor of 2. It was also decided to FIG. 3.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 apply the same factor to the uncertainties of all the data that contribute in a significant way to the determination of h, so that the relative weights of this set of data are unchanged. [Recall that if the difference between two values of the same quantity is audiff and the uncertainty of each is increased by a factor b, the difference is reduced to ða=bÞudiff .] Thus, adjust- ment 2 differs from adjustment 1 in that the uncertainties of data items B36:1, B36:2, B37:1 to B37:5, and B54 in Table XX, which are the two values of KJ, the five values of K2JRK, and the value of NA, are increased by a factor of 2. [Although items B34:1, B34:2, and B38, the two values of �0p�90ðhiÞ and F 90, also contribute to the determination of h, their contribution is small and no multiplicative factor is applied.] From Tables XXXVI and XXXVII we see that the values of � and h from adjustment 2 are very nearly the same as from adjustment 1, that jrij for both B37:3 and B54 have been reduced to below 1.4, and that the residual for �0p�90ðloÞ is unchanged. Adjustment 3: Adjustment 3 is the adjustment on which the 2010 CODATA recommended values are based, and as such it is referred to as the ‘‘final adjustment.’’ It differs from adjust- ment 2 in that, following the prescription described above, 18 input data with values of Sc less than 0.01 are deleted.

Further, because h=mð133CsÞ, item B56, is deleted as an input datum due to its low weight, the two values ofArð133CsÞ, itemsB10:1 and 10.2,which are not relevant to any other input datum, are also deleted and Arð133CsÞ is omitted as an adjusted constant. This brings the total number of omitted data items to 20. Table XXXVI shows that deleting them has virtually no impact on the values of� and h and Birge ratioRB. The data for the final adjustment are quite consistent, as dem- onstrated by the value of �2: pð58:1j67Þ ¼ 0:77. Adjustments 4 and 5: The purpose of these adjustments is to test the robustness of the 2010 recommended values of � and h by omitting the most accurate data relevant to these constants. Adjustment 4 differs from adjustment 2 in that the four data that provide values of � with the smallest uncer- tainties are deleted, namely, items B13:1, B13:2, B56 and B57, the two values of ae and the values of h=mð133CsÞ and h=mð87RbÞ; see the first four entries of Table XXV. [For the same reason as in adjustment 3, in adjustment 4 the two values of Arð133CsÞ are also deleted as input data and Arð133CsÞ is omitted as an adjusted constant; the same applies to Arð87RbÞ.] Adjustment 5 differs from adjustment 1 in that the three data that provide values of h with the smallest uncertainties are deleted, namely, items B37:2, B37:3, and B54, the two NIST values of K2JRK and the IAC value of NA; see the first three entries of Table XXVI. Also deleted are the data with Sc < 0:01 that contribute in a minimal way to the determination of � and are deleted in the final adjustment. Table XXXVI shows that the value of � from the less TABLE XXX. The 28 adjusted constants (variables) used in the least-squares multivariate analysis of the Rydberg-constant data given in Table XVIII.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 accurate �-related data used in adjustment 4, and the value of h from the less accurate h-related data used in adjustment 5 agree with the corresponding recommended values from adjustment 3. This agreement provides a consistency check on the 2010 recommended values. Adjustments 6 to 12: The aim of the seven adjustments summarized in Table XXXVIII is to investigate the data that determine the recommended values of R1, rp, and rd. Results from adjustment 3, the final adjustment, are included in the table for reference purposes. We begin with a discussion of adjustments 6–10, which are derived from adjustment 3 by deleting selected input data. We then discuss adjustments 11 and 12, which examine the impact of the value of the proton rms charge radius derived from the measurement of the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen discussed in Sec. IV.A.3.b and given in Eq. (97). Note that the value of R1 depends only weakly on the data in Tables XX and XXII. In adjustment 6, the electron-scattering values of rp and rd, data items A49:1, A49:2, and A50 in Table XVIII, are not included. Thus, the values of these two quantities from adjust- ment 6 are based solely on H and D spectroscopic data. It is evident from a comparison of the results of this adjustment and adjustment 3 that the scattering values of the radii play a smaller role than the spectroscopic data in determining the 2010 recommended values of R1, rp, and rd. Adjustment 7 is based on only hydrogen data, including the two scattering values of rp but not the difference between the 1S1=2–2S1=2 transition frequencies in H and D, item A48 in Table XVIII, hereafter referred to as the isotope shift. Adjustment 8 differs from adjustment 7 in that the two scattering values of rp are deleted. Adjustments 9 and 10 are similar to 7 and 8 but are based on only deuterium data; that is, adjustment 9 includes the scattering value of rd but not the isotope shift, while for adjustment 10 the scattering value is deleted. The results of these four adjustments show the dominant role of the hydrogen data and the importance of the isotope shift in determining the recommended value of rd. Further, the four values of R1 from these adjustments agree TABLE XXXII. The 39 adjusted constants (variables) used in the least-squares multivariate analysis of the input data in Table XX.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 with the 2010 recommended value, and the two values of rp and of rd also agree with their respective recommended values: the largest difference from the recommended value for the eight results is 1:4udiff . Adjustment 11 differs from adjustment 3 in that it includes the muonic hydrogen value rp ¼ 0:841 69ð66Þ fm, and ad- justment 12 differs from adjustment 11 in that the three scattering values of the nuclear radii are deleted. Because the muonic hydrogen value is significantly smaller and has a significantly smaller uncertainty than the purely spectro- scopic value of adjustment 6 and the two scattering values, it has a major impact on the results of adjustments 11 and 12, as can be seen from Table XXXVIII: for both adjustments the value of R1 shifts down by over 6 standard deviations and its uncertainty is reduced by a factor of 4.6. Moreover, and not surprisingly, the values of rp and of rd from both adjustments are significantly smaller than the recommended values and have significantly smaller uncertainties. The inconsistencies between the muonic hydrogen result for rp and the spectro- scopic and scattering results is demonstrated by the large value and low probability of �2 for adjustment 11; pð104:9j68Þ ¼ 0:0027. The impact of the muonic hydrogen value of rp can also be seen by examining for adjustments 3, 11, and 12 the normal- ized residuals and self-sensitivity coefficients of the principal experimental data that determine R1, namely, items A26–A50 of Table XVIII. In brief, jrij for these data in the final adjustment range from near 0 to 1.24 for item A50, the rd scattering result, with the vast majority being less than 1. For the three greater than 1, jrij is 1.03, 1.08, and 1.04. The value of Sc is 1.00 for items A26 and A48, the hydrogen 1S1=2–2S1=2 transition frequency and the H-D isotope shift; and 0.42 for Type of input datum Observational equation Sec.

(Continued) 1582 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 item A49:2, which is the more accurate of the two scattering values of rp. Most others are a few percent, although some values of Sc are near 0. The situation is markedly different for adjustment 12. First, jrij for item A30, the hydrogen transition frequency involving the 8D5=2 state, is 3.06 compared to 0.87 in adjustment 3; and items A41, A42, and A43, deuterium transitions involving the 8S1=2, 8D3=2, and 8D5=2 states, are now 2.5, 2.4, and 3.0, respectively, compared to 0.40, 0.17, and 0.68. Further, ten other transitions have residuals in the range 1.02 to 1.76. As a result, with this proton radius, the predictions of the theory for hydrogen and deuterium tran- sition frequencies are not generally consistent with the ex- periments. Equally noteworthy is the fact that although Sc for items A26 and A48 remain equal to 1.00, for all other transition frequencies Sc is less than 0.01, which means that they play an inconsequential role in determining R1. The results for adjustment 11, which includes the scattering values of the nuclear radii as well as the muonic hydrogen value, are similar. In view of the impact of the latter value on the internal consistency of the R1 data and its disagreement with the spectroscopic and scattering values, the Task Group decided that it was premature to include it as an input datum in the 2010 CODATA adjustment; it was deemed more prudent to wait to see if further research can resolve the discrepancy; see Sec. IV.A.3.b for additional discussion. 3.

(285) and (286) leads to the modified obser- vational equations given in Table XXXIX. Although the NIST value of k=h, item B60, was obtained using the Josephson and quantum Hall effects, it is not included in the tests of the relations KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2, because of its large uncertainty. The results of seven different adjustments are summarized in Table XXIX. An entry of 0 in the �K column means that it is assumed that RK ¼ h=e2 in the corresponding adjustment; similarly, an entry of 0 in the �J column means that it is assumed that KJ ¼ 2e=h in the corresponding adjustment. The following comments apply to the adjustments of Table XXIX. Adjustment (i) uses all of the data and thus differs from adjustment 1 of Table XXXVI discussed in the previous section only in that the assumption KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2 is relaxed. For this adjustment, � ¼ 86, �2 ¼ 78:1, and RB ¼ 1:02. The normalized residuals ri for the three inconsistent data items in Table XXXVII, the companion table to Table XXXVI, are 0.75, �0:56, and 2.88. Examination of Table XXIX shows that �K is consistent with 0 within 1.2 times its uncertainty of 1:8� 10�8, while �J is consistent with 0 within 2.4 times its uncertainty of 2:4� 10�8. It is important to recognize that any conclusions that can be drawn from the values of �K and �J of adjustment (i) must be tempered, because not all of the individual values of �K and �J that contribute to their determination are consistent. This is demonstrated by adjustments (ii)–(vii) and Figs. 7 and 8. [Because of their comparatively small uncertainties, it is possible in these adjustments to take the 2010 recommended values for the constants ae, �, R1, and ArðeÞ, which appear in the observational equations of Table XXXIX, and assume that they are exactly known.] Adjustments (ii) and (iii) focus on �K: �J is set equal to 0 and values of �K are obtained from data whose observational equations are independent of h.

Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 of RK, items B35:1–B35:5; and the three low-field gyromag- netic ratios, items B32:1, B32:2, and B33. We see from Table XXIX that the two values of �K resulting from the two adjustments not only have opposite signs but their dif- ference is 3:0udiff . Figure 7 compares the combined value of �K obtained from the five values of RK with the five individ- ual values, while Fig. 8 does the same for the results obtained from the three gyromagnetic ratios. Adjustments (iv)–(vii) focus on �J: �K is set equal to 0 and values of �J are, with the exception of adjustment (iv), obtained from data whose observational equations are dependent on h. Examination of Table XXIX shows that although the values of �J from adjustments (iv) and (v) are of opposite sign, their difference of 49:1� 10�8 is less than the 73:0� 10�8 uncertainty of the difference. However, the difference between the values of �J from adjustments (iv) and (vi) is 3:6udiff , and is 3:3udiff even for the value of �J from adjustment (vii), in which the uncertainties of the most accurate data have been increased by the factor 2. (The multiplicative factor 2 is that used in adjustment 2 and FIG. 7. Comparison of the five individual values of �K obtained from the five values of RK, data items B35:1–B35:5, and the combined value (open circle) from adjustment (ii) given in Table XXIX. The applicable observational equation in Table XXXIX is B35�. FIG. 8. Comparison of the three individual values of �K obtained from the three low-field gyromagnetic ratios, data items B32:1, B32:2, and B33, and the combined value (open circle) from adjustment (iii) given in Table XXIX. The applicable observational equations in Table XXXIX are B32� and B33�. Because of the form of these equations, the value of �K when �J ¼ 0 is identical to the value of �J when �K ¼ 0, hence the label at the bottom of the figure. TABLE XXXIX.

On the other hand, we see that the value of �J from adjustment (vi) is consistent with 0 only to within 3.9 times its uncertainty, but that this is reduced to 2.0 for the value of �J from adjustment (vii) which uses expanded uncertainties. The results of the adjustments discussed above reflect the disagreement of the NIST-07 watt-balance value for K2JRK, and to a lesser extent that of the similar NIST-98 value, items B37:3 and B37:2, with the IAC-11 enriched silicon value of NA, item B54; and the disagreement of the NIST-89 result for �0p�90ðloÞ, and to a lesser extent the KR/VN-98 result for �0h�90ðloÞ, items B32:1 and B33, with the highly accurate values of �. If adjustment (i) is repeated with these five data deleted, we find �K ¼ 2:8ð1:8Þ � 10�8 and �J ¼ 15ð49Þ � 10�8. These values can be interpreted as confirming that �K is consistent with 0 to within 1.6 times its uncertainty of 1:8� 10�8 and that �J is consistent with 0 well within its uncertainty of 49� 10�8. We conclude this section by briefly discussing recent efforts to close the metrology triangle. Although there are variants, the basic idea is to use a single electron tunneling (SET) device that generates a quantized current I ¼ ef when an alternating voltage of frequency f is applied to it, where as usual e is the elementary charge. The current I is then compared to a current derived from Josephson and quantum-Hall-effect devices. In view of quantization of charge in units of e and conservation of charge, the equality of the currents shows that KJRKe ¼ 2, as expected, within the uncertainty of the measurements (Keller, 2008; Keller et al., 2008; Feltin and Piquemal, 2009). Although there is no indication from the results reported to date that this relation is not valid, the uncertainties of the results are at best at the 1 to 2 parts in 106 level (Keller, Zimmerman, and Eichenberger, 2007; Keller et al., 2008; Feltin et al., 2011; Camarota et al., 2012). XIV. THE 2010 CODATA RECOMMENDED VALUES A. Calculational details The 168 input data and their correlation coefficients initially considered for inclusion in the 2010 CODATA adjustment of the values of the constants are given in Tables XVIII, XIX,XX, XXI, XXII, and XXIII. The 2010 recommended values are based on adjustment 3, called the final adjustment, summa- rized in TablesXXXVI, XXXVII, andXXXVIII and discussed in the associated text. Adjustment 3 omits 20 of the 168 initially considered input data, namely, items B10:1, B10:2, B13:1,B32:1–B36:2,B37:5,B38,B56,B59, andB60, because of their low weight (self-sensitivity coefficient Sc < 0:01). However, because the observational equation for h=mð133CsÞ, item B56, depends on Arð133CsÞ but item B56 is deleted because of its low weight, the two values of Arð133CsÞ, items B10:1 and B10:2, are also deleted and Arð133CsÞ itself is deleted as an adjusted constant. Further, the initial uncertain- ties of five input data, items B37:1–B37:4 and B54, are multi- plied by the factor 2, with the result that the absolute values of the normalized residuals jrij of the five data are less than 1.4 and their disagreement is reduced to an acceptable level. Each input datum in this final adjustment has a self- sensitivity coefficient Sc greater than 0.01, or is a subset of the data of an experiment or series of experiments that provide an input datum or input data with Sc > 0:01.

For example, if the 11 values of G with expanded uncertainties are added to the 148 input data of adjustment 3, G is taken as an additional adjusted constant so that these 11 values can be included in a new adjustment using the observational equation G ¼: G, and the so-modified adjustment 3 is repeated, then we find for this ‘‘grand final adjustment’’ that N ¼ 160, M ¼ 83, � ¼ 77, �2 ¼ 59:1, pð59:1j77Þ ¼ 0:94, and RB ¼ 0:88. Of course, the resulting values of the adjusted constants, and of the normal- ized residuals and self-sensitivity coefficients of the input data, are exactly the same as those from adjustment 3 and the weighted mean of the 11 measured values ofGwith expanded uncertainties. In any event, the 2010 recommended values are calculated from the set of best estimated values, in the least-squares sense, of 82 adjusted constants, including G, and their var- iances and covariances, together with (i) those constants that have exact values such as �0 and c; and (ii) the values of m�, GF, and sin 2�W given in Sec. XII of this report; see Sec. V.B of CODATA-98 for details. B. Tables of values Tables XL, XLI, XLII, XLIII, XLIV, XLV, XLVI, and XLVII give the 2010 CODATA recommended values of the basic constants and conversion factors of physics and chem- istry and related quantities. Although very similar in form and content to their 2006 counterparts, several new recommended values have been included in the 2010 tables and a few have been deleted. The values of the four new constants, mn �mp in kg and u, and ðmn �mpÞc2 in J and MeV, are given in Table XLI under the heading ‘‘Neutron, n’’; and the values of the four new constants �h, �h=�B, �h=�N, and gh are given in the same table under the heading ‘‘Helion, h.’’ The three constants deleted, �t=�e, �t=�p, and �t=�n, were in the 2006 version of Table XLI under the heading ‘‘Triton, t.’’ It was decided that these constants were of limited interest and the values can be calculated from other constants in the table. The values of the four new helion-related constants are calculated from the adjusted constant �0h=� 0 p and the theoretically predicted shielding correction �h ¼ 59:967 43ð10Þ � 10�6 due to Rudziński, Puchalski, and Pachucki (2009) using the relation �0h ¼ �hð1� �hÞ; see Sec. VI.A.2. Table XL is a highly abbreviated list of the values of the constants and conversion factors most commonly used. Table XLI is a much more extensive list of values categorized as follows: UNIVERSAL; ELECTROMAGNETIC; ATOMIC AND NUCLEAR; and PHYSICOCHEMICAL. The ATOMIC AND NUCLEAR category is subdivided into 11 subcategories: General; Electroweak; Electron, e�; Muon, ��; Tau, ��; Proton, p; Neutron, n; Deuteron, d; Triton, t; Helion, h; and Alpha particle, �. Table XLII gives the var- iances, covariances, and correlation coefficients of a selected group of constants. (Use of the covariance matrix is discussed in Appendix E of CODATA-98.) Table XLIII gives the inter- nationally adopted values of various quantities; Table XLIV lists thevalues of a number ofx-ray related quantities;TableXLV lists the values of various non-SI units; and Tables XLVI and XLVII give the values of various energy equivalents. All of thevalues given inTablesXL,XLI,XLII,XLIII,XLIV, XLV, XLVI, and XLVII are available on the Web pages of the Fundamental Constants Data Center of the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory at physics.nist.gov/constants.

XV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The focus of this section is (i) comparison of the 2010 and 2006 recommended values of the constants and identification of those new results that have contributed most to the changes in the 2006 values; (ii) presentation of several conclusions that can be drawn from the 2010 recommended values and the input data on which they are based; and (iii) identification of new experimental and theoretical work that can advance our knowledge of the values of the constants. Topic (iii) is of special importance in light of the adoption by the 24thGeneral Conference onWeights andMeasures (CGPM) at its meeting in Paris in October 2011 of Resolution 1 entitled ‘‘On the possible future revision of the International System of Units, the SI,’’ available on theBIPMWeb site at bipm.org/utils/ common/pdf/24_CGPM_Resolutions.pdf. In brief, this resolution notes the intention of the CIPM to propose, possibly to the 25th CGPM in 2014, a revision of the SI. The ‘‘new SI,’’ as it is called to distinguish it from the current SI, will be the system of units in which seven refer- ence constants, including the Planck constant h, elementary charge e, Boltzmann constant k, and Avogadro constant NA, have exact assigned values. Resolution 1 also looks to CODATA to provide the necessary values of these four con- stants for the new definition. Details of the proposed new SI may be found in Mills et al. (2011) and the references cited therein; see also Mohr and Newell (2010) and Taylor (2011). A. Comparison of 2010 and 2006 CODATA recommended values Table XLVIII compares the 2010 and 2006 recommended values of a representative group of constants. The fact that the values of many constants are obtained from expressions propor- tional to the fine-structure constant �, Planck constant h, or molar gas constant R raised to various powers leads to the regularities observed in the numbers in columns 2 to 4. For example, the first six quantities are obtained from expressions proportional to �a, where jaj ¼ 1, 2, 3, or 6. The next 15 quantities, h through the magnetic moment of the proton �p, are calculated from expressions containing the factor ha, where jaj ¼ 1 or 1=2. And the five quantities R through the Stefan- Boltzmannconstant� are proportional toRa,where jaj ¼ 1 or4. Further comments on some of the entries in Table XLVIII are as follows. (i) The large shift in the 2006 recommended value of � is mainly due to the discovery and correction of an error in the numerically calculated value of the eighth-order coefficientA ð8Þ 1 in the theoretical expression for ae; see Sec. V.A.1. Its reduction in uncertainty is due to two new results. The first is the 2008 improved value of ae obtained at Harvard University with a relative standard uncertainty of 2:4� 10�10 compared to the 6:6� 10�10 uncertainty of the earlier Harvard result used in the 2006 adjustment. The second result is the 2011 improved LKB atom-recoil value of h=mð87RbÞ with an uncertainty of 1:2� 10�9 compared to the 1:3� 10�8 uncertainty of the earlier LKB result used in 2006. The much reduced uncertainty of ge is also due to the improved value of �. (ii) The change in the 2006 recommended value of h is due to the 2011 IAC result for NA with a relative standard uncer- tainty of 3:0� 10�8 obtained using 28Si enriched single crys- tals. It provides a value of hwith the same uncertainty, which is smaller than the 3:6� 10�8 uncertainty of the value of h from the 2007 NIST watt-balance measurement of K2JRK; the latter played the dominant role in determining the 2006 recom- mended value. The two differ by about 18 parts in 108, resulting in a shift of the 2006 recommended value by nearly twice its uncertainty. In the 2006 adjustment inconsistencies among some of the electrical and silicon crystal data (all involving natural silicon) led the Task Group to increase the uncertainties of these data by the multiplicative factor 1.5 to reduce the inconsistencies to an acceptable level. In the 2010 adjustment, inconsistencies among the data that deter- mine h are reduced to an acceptable level by using a multi- plicative factor of 2. Consequently the uncertainties of the 2006 and 2010 recommended values of h do not differ significantly. (iii) The 2006 recommended value of the molar gas con- stant R was determined by the 1988 NIST speed-of-sound result with a relative standard uncertainty of 1:8� 10�6, and to a much lesser extent the 1979 NPL speed-of-sound result with an uncertainty of 8:4� 10�6 obtained with a rather different type of apparatus. The six new data of potential interest related to R that became available during the four years between the 2006 and 2010 adjustments have uncertainties ranging from 1:2� 10�6 to 12� 10�6 and agree with each other as well as with the NIST and NPL values. Further, the self-sensitivity coefficients of four of the six were sufficiently large for them to be included in the 2010 final adjustment, and they are responsible for the small shift in the 2006 recommended value and the reduction of its uncertainty by nearly a factor of 2. (iv) Other constants in Table XLVIII whose changes are worth noting are the Rydberg constant R1, proton relative atomic mass ArðpÞ, and f220g natural Si lattice spacing d220. The reduction in uncertainty of R1 is due to improvements in the theory of H and D energy levels and the 2010 LKB result for the 1S1=2–3S1=2 transition frequency in hydrogen with a relative standard uncertainty of 4:4� 10�12. For ArðpÞ, the reduction in uncertainty is due to the 2008 Stockholm University (SMILETRAP) result for the ratio of the cyclotron frequency of the excited hydrogen molecular ion to that of the deuteron, fcðHþ�2 Þ=fcðdÞ, with a relative uncertainty of 1:7� 10�10. The changes in d220 arise from the omission of the 1999 PTB result for h=mnd220ðW04Þ, the 2004 NMIJ result for d220ðNR3Þ, the 2007 INRIM results for d220ðW4:2aÞ, and d220ðMO�Þ, and the inclusion of the new 2008 INRIM result for d220ðMO�Þ as well as the new 2009 INRIM results for d220ðW04Þ and d220ðW4:2aÞ. B. Some implications of the 2010 CODATA recommended values and adjustment for metrology and physics Conventional electric units. The adoption of the conventional valuesKJ�90 ¼ 483 597:9 GHz=V andRK�90 ¼ 25 812:807 � for the Josephson and von Klitzing constants in 1990 can be Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 viewed as establishing conventional, practical units of voltage and resistance,V90 and�90, given byV90 ¼ ðKJ�90=KJÞ V and �90 ¼ ðRK=RK�90Þ �. Other conventional electric units fol- low from V90 and �90, for example, A90 ¼ V90=�90, C90 ¼ A90 s, W90 ¼ A90V90, F90 ¼ C90=V90, and H90 ¼ �90 s, which are the conventional, practical units of current, charge, power, capacitance, and inductance, respectively (Taylor and Mohr, 2001). For the relations between KJ and KJ�90, and RK and RK�90, the 2010 adjustment gives KJ ¼ KJ�90½1� 6:3ð2:2Þ � 10�8�; (287) RK ¼ RK�90½1þ 1:718ð32Þ � 10�8�; (288) which lead to V90 ¼ ½1þ 6:3ð2:2Þ � 10�8� V; (289) �90 ¼ ½1þ 1:718ð32Þ � 10�8� �; (290) A90 ¼ ½1þ 4:6ð2:2Þ � 10�8� A; (291) C90 ¼ ½1þ 4:6ð2:2Þ � 10�8� C; (292) W90 ¼ ½1þ 10:8ð4:4Þ � 10�8� W; (293) F90 ¼ ½1� 1:718ð32Þ � 10�8� F; (294) H90 ¼ ½1þ 1:718ð32Þ � 10�8� H: (295) Equations (289) and (290) show that V90 exceeds V and �90 exceeds � by the fractional amounts 6:3ð2:2Þ � 10�8 and 1:718ð32Þ � 10�8, respectively. Thismeans thatmeasured voltages and resistances traceable to the Josephson effect and KJ�90 and the quantumHall effect andRK�90, respectively, are too small relative to the SI by these same fractional amounts. However, these differences are well within the 40� 10�8 uncertainty assigned to V90=V and the 10� 10�8 uncertainty assigned to �90=� by the Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM) of the CIPM (Quinn, 1989, 2001). Josephson and quantum Hall effects. Although there is extensive theoretical and experimental evidence for the exact- ness of the Josephson and quantum-Hall-effect relations KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2, and some of the input data available for the 2010 adjustment provide additional supportive evidence for these expressions, some other data are not supportive. This dichotomy reflects the rather significant inconsistencies among a few key data, particularly the highly accurate IAC enriched silicon XRCD result for NA, and the comparably accurate NISTwatt-balance result for K2JRK, and will only be fully resolved when the inconsistencies are reconciled. The new SI. Implementation of the new SI requires that the four reference constants h, e, k, and NA must be known with sufficiently small uncertainties to meet current and future measurement needs. However, of equal if not greater impor- tance, the causes of any inconsistencies among the data that provide their valuesmust be understood.Although the key data that provide the 2010 recommended value of kwould appear to be close tomeeting both requirements, this is not the case for h, e, and NA, which are in fact interrelated. We have NAh ¼ cArðeÞMu�2 2R1 ; (296) e ¼ � 2�h �0c � 1=2 : (297) Since the combined relative standard uncertainty of the 2010 recommended values of the constants on the right-hand side of Eq. (296) is only 7:0� 10�10, a measurement of h with a given relative uncertainty, even as small as 5� 10�9, determines NA with essentially the same relative uncertainty. Further, since the recommended value of � has a relative uncertainty of only 3:2� 10�10, based on Eq. (297) the relative uncertainty of e will be half that of h or NA. For these reasons, the 2010 recommended values of h and NA have the same 4:4� 10�8 relative uncertainty, and the un- certainty of the recommended value of e is 2:2� 10�8. However, these uncertainties are twice as large as they would have been if there were no disagreement between the watt- balance values of h and the enriched silicon XRCD value of NA. This disagreement led to an increase in the uncertainties of the relevant data by a factor of 2. More specifically, if the data had been consistent the uncertainties of the recommended values of h and NA would be 2:2� 10�8 and 1:1� 10�8 for e. Because these should be sufficiently small for the new SI to be implemented, the significance of the disagreement and the importance of measurements of h and NA are apparent. Proton radius. The proton rms charge radius rp determined from the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen disagrees signifi- cantly with values determined from H and D transition frequencies as well as from electron-proton scattering experi- ments. Although the uncertainty of the muonic hydrogen value is significantly smaller than the uncertainties of these other values, its negative impact on the internal consistency of the theoretically predicted and experimentally measured fre- quencies, as well as on the value of the Rydberg constant, was deemed so severe that the only recourse was not to include it in the final least-squares adjustment on which the 2010 recommended values are based. Muon magnetic-moment anomaly. Despite extensive new theoretical work, the long-standing significant difference be- tween the theoretically predicted, standard-model value of a� and the experimentally determined value remains unresolved. Because the difference is from 3.3 to possibly 4.5 times the standard uncertainty of the difference, depending on the way the all-important hadronic contribution to the theoretical expression for a� is evaluated, the theory was not incorpo- rated in the 2010 adjustment. The recommended values of a� and those of other constants that depend on it are, therefore, based on experiment. Electron magnetic-moment anomaly, fine-structure con- stant, and QED. The most accurate value of the fine-structure constant � currently available from a single experiment has a relative standard uncertainty of 3:7� 10�10; it is obtained by equating the QED theoretical expression for the electron magnetic-moment anomaly ae and the most accurate experi- mental value of ae, obtained from measurements on a single electron in a Penning trap. This value of � is in excellent agreement with a competitive experimental value with an 1596 Peter J. Mohr, Barry N. Taylor, and David B. Newell: CODATA recommended values of the fundamental . . . Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, October–December 2012 uncertainty of 6:6� 10�10. Because the latter is obtained from the atom-recoil determination of the quotient h=mð87RbÞ using atom-interferometry and is only weakly dependent on QED theory, the agreement provides one of the most significant confirmations of quantum electrodynamics. Newtonian constant of gravitation. The situation regarding measurements of G continues to be problematic and has become more so in the past four years. Two new results with comparatively small uncertainties have become avail- able for the 2010 adjustment, leading to an increase in the scatter among the now 11 values of G. This has resulted in a 20% increase in the uncertainty of the 2010 recommended value compared to that of its 2006 predecessor. Clearly, there is a continuing problem for the determination of this impor- tant, but poorly known, fundamental constant; the uncertainty of the 2010 recommended value is now 120 parts in 106. C. Suggestions for future work For evaluation of the fundamental constants, it is desirable not only to have multiple results with competitive uncertain- ties for a given quantity, but also to have one or more results obtained by a different method. If the term ‘‘redundant’’ is used to describe such an ideal set of data, there is usually only limited redundancy among the key data available for any given CODATA adjustment. With this in mind, based on the preceding discussion, our suggestions are as follows: (i) Resolution of the disagreement between the most ac- curate watt-balance result for K2JRK and the XRCD result for NA. Approaches to solving this problem might include new measurements of K2JRK using watt balances of different design (or their equivalent) with uncertainties at the 2 to 3 parts in 108 level, a thorough review by the researchers involved of their existing measurements of this quantity, tests of the exactness of the relations KJ ¼ 2e=h and RK ¼ h=e2, indepen- dent measurements of the isotopic composition of the enriched silicon crystals and their d220 lattice spacing used in the determination of NA (these are the two principal quantities for which only one measurement exists), and a thorough review by the researchers in- volved of the many corrections required to obtain NA from the principal quantities measured. (ii) Measurements of k (and related quantities such as k=h) with uncertainties at the 1 to 3 parts in 106 level using the techniques of dielectric gas thermometry, refrac- tive index gas thermometry, noise thermometry, and Doppler broadening. These methods are very different from acoustic gas thermometry, which is the dominant method used to date. (iii) Resolution of the discrepancy between the muonic hydrogen inferred value of rp and the spectroscopic value from H and D transition frequencies. Work underway on frequency measurements in hydrogen as well as the analysis of ��p and ��d data and possible measurements in ��h and ��� should pro- vide additional useful information. Independent evaluations of electron-scattering data to determine rp are encouraged as well as verification of the theory of H, D, and muonic hydrogenlike energy levels. (iv) Independent calculation of the eighth- and tenth-order coefficients in the QED expression for ae, in order to increase confidence in the value of � from ae. (v) Resolution of the disagreement between the theoretical expression for a� and its experimental value. This discrepancy along with the discrepancy between the- ory and experiment in muonic hydrogen are two im- portant problems in muon-related physics. (vi) Determinations of G with an uncertainty of 1 part in 105 using new and innovative approaches that might resolve the disagreements among the measurements made within the past three decades.
