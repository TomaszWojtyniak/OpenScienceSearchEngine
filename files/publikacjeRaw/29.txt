Abstract. The paper deals with F-normed functions and sequence spaces. First, some general results on such spaces are presented. But most of the results in this paper concern various monotonicity properties and various Kadec–Klee properties of F-normed Orlicz functions and sequence spaces and their subspaces of elements with order continuous norm, when they are generated by monotone Orlicz functions on R+ and equipped with the classical Mazur–Orlicz F-norm. Strict monotonicity, lower (and upper) local uniform monotonicity and uniform monotonicity in the classical sense as well as their orthogonal counterparts are considered. It follows from the criteria that are presented for these properties that all the above classical monotonicity properties except for uniform monotonicity differ from their orthogonal counterparts [in contrast to Köthe spaces (see Hudzik et al. in Rocky Mt J Math 30(3):933–950, 2000)]. The Kadec–Klee properties that are considered in this paper correspond to various kinds of convergence: convergence locally in measure and convergence globally in measure for function spaces, uniform convergence and coordinatewise convergence in the case of sequence spaces.

Cui et al. AEM 1. Introduction The geometry of Banach spaces has found a lot of applications (approximation theory, fixed point theory, ergodic theory, control theory, probability theory, theory of vector analytic functions, theory of generalized inverses) and has been intensively developed during the last decades. Monotonicity properties (strict and uniform monotonicity) play a similar role in the theory of Banach lattices as the respective rotundity properties (rotundity and uniform rotun- dity) in the theory of Banach spaces. Recall that monotonicity properties are restrictions of appropriate rotundity properties to the set of couples of compa- rable elements in the positive cone of a Banach lattice (see [17]). Consequently, if we restrict ourselves to Banach spaces being Banach lattices, then in many cases, good rotundity properties can be replaced successfully by respective monotonicity properties. It is known that monotonicity properties (strict and uniform monotonicity) play an analogous role in the best dominated approx- imation problems in Banach lattices as the respective rotundity properties (strict and uniform rotundity) do in the best approximation problems in Ba- nach spaces (see [7,33]). Moreover, monotonicity properties are applicable in ergodic theory, since they provide a tool for estimating a norm (see [1]). Uniform monotonicity was introduced and studied by Birkhoff in [3]. Next, the various monotonicity properties and their applications to dominated best approximation and complex rotundities have been intensively investigated by many mathematicians (see [6,7,9,16,20,22,29,30,33,34]). It is worth mention- ing that also Kadec–Klee properties are applicable in the best dominated ap- proximation problems in Banach lattices (see [8] and the references therein). Our paper offers an extension of results on monotonicity and Kadec–Klee properties of Banach function lattices to F -normed function lattices, specifi- cally to F -normed Orlicz spaces (compare with [5,8–12,19,21,22,24,26–28,33, 34]). 2. Preliminaries Denote by N, R the sets of natural and real numbers, respectively. Let R+ := [0,∞). Given any real vector space X the functional X � x �→ ‖x‖ ∈ R+, is called an F-norm if the following conditions are satisfied: (i) ‖x‖ = 0 if and only if x = 0; (ii) ‖ − x‖ = ‖x‖ for all x ∈ X; (iii) ‖x + y‖ ≤ ‖x‖ + ‖y‖ for all x, y ∈ X; (iv) ‖λnxn − λx‖ → 0 whenever ‖xn − x‖ → 0 and λn → λ for any x ∈ X, (xn)∞n=1 in X, λ ∈ R and (λn)∞n=1 in R. We say that an F -normed space X = (X, ‖·‖) is an F -space if it is complete with respect to the F -norm topology. Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 313 As usual, S(X) (resp. B(X)) stands for the unit sphere (resp. the closed unit ball) of a real F -normed space (X, ‖·‖X). 2.1. F -normed Köthe spaces Let (Ω,Σ, μ) be a complete σ-finite measure space and L0 = L0(μ) be the space of all (equivalence) classes of Σ-measurable real-valued functions defined on Ω. Definition 2.1. An F -space (E, ‖ · ‖E) is called an F -normed Köthe space if it is a linear subspace of L0 satisfying the following conditions. (i) If x ∈ L0, y ∈ E and |x| ≤ |y| μ-a.e., then x ∈ E and ‖x‖E ≤ ‖y‖E . (ii) There exists a strictly positive x ∈ E (called a weak unit). Clearly, each F -normed Köthe space is an F -lattice. If, in addition, the measure μ is non-atomic, then we say that E is an F -normed (Köthe) function space. If we consider E over the counting measure space ( N, 2N, μ ) , then we say that E is an F -normed (Köthe) sequence space. By E+ we denote the positive cone of E, that is, E+ = {x ∈ E : x ≥ 0}. For a measurable function x set supp x = {t ∈ Ω : x (t) = 0} . Note for x ∈ L0 (the equivalence class of measurable functions which are equal μ−a.e.) the set supp x is determined up to a set of measure zero. Recall that an F -normed function space E is called order continuous (E ∈ (OC)) if for each x ∈ E and every sequence 0 ≤ xn ≤ |x| with xn → 0 μ−a.e. we have ‖xn‖E → 0 (see [25,35,46]). The symbol Ea stands for the subspace of all order continuous elements of E. Recall that E has the Fatou property (E ∈ (FP )) if for any x ∈ L0 and any (xn) ∞ n=1 in E such that 0 ≤ xn ↗ x μ−a.e. in Ω and supn∈N ‖xn‖E < ∞, we have x ∈ E and limn ‖xn‖E = ‖x‖E . Recall that in the definition of a semi-Fatou property (E ∈ (s − FP )) we assume that x ∈ E instead of x ∈ L0. A point x ∈ E is said to be an Hg-point (resp. Hl-point) in E if for any (xn) ⊂ E such that xn → x globally (resp. locally) in measure and ‖xn‖E → ‖x‖E , we have ‖xn − x‖E → 0. We say that the space E has the Kadec–Klee property globally (resp. locally) in measure if each x ∈ E is an Hg-point (resp. Hl-point) in E. Note that if we consider the above two Kadec–Klee properties in E being an F -normed Köthe sequence space, then we get the Kadec–Klee properties with respect to uniform (coordinatewise) convergence, respectively. We denote these properties by Hu (Hc), respectively. Definition 2.2. An F -normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E) is said to be strictly mono- tone (E ∈ (SM) for short) if for any x, y ∈ E such that 0 ≤ y ≤ x, we have ‖y‖E < ‖x‖E whenever y = x (or equivalently ‖x − y‖E < ‖x‖E whenever y = 0) (see [3]). 314 Y. Cui et al. AEM Definition 2.3. An F -normed Köthe space E is said to be orthogonally strictly monotone (E ∈ (OSM) for short) if for any x ∈ E+\{0} and any A ∈ Σ ∩ suppx with μ(A) > 0, we have ‖xχΩ\A‖E < ‖x‖E . Definition 2.4. An F -normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E) is said to be lower locally uniformly monotone (E ∈ (LLUM) for short) if for any x ∈ E and (xn)∞n=1 in E such that 0 ≤ xn ≤ x for all n ∈ N and ‖xn‖E → ‖x‖E as n → ∞, the condition ‖x − xn‖E → 0 as n → ∞ holds. Definition 2.5. An F -normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E) is said to be orthogonally lower locally uniformly monotone (E ∈ (OLLUM) for short) if for any x ∈ E+\{0} and any (An)∞n=1 in Σ the following implication is satisfied: ( ‖xχAn‖E → n→∞ ‖x‖E ) ⇒ ( ‖x − xχAn‖E = ‖xχΩ\An‖E → n→∞ 0 ) . Definition 2.6. An F -normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E) is said to be upper locally uniformly monotone (E ∈ (ULUM) for short) if for any x ∈ E+ and (xn)∞n=1 in E+ such that x ≤ xn for all n ∈ N and ‖xn‖E → ‖x‖E as n → ∞, the condition ‖xn − x‖E → 0 as n → ∞ holds. Definition 2.7. An F -normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E) is said to be orthogonally upper locally uniformly monotone (E ∈ (OULUM) for short) if for any x ∈ E+\{0} such that μ(suppE\ supp x) > 0 and any xn ∈ E+ with suppxn ⊂ suppE\ supp x, if ‖x + xn‖E → ‖x‖E then ‖xn‖E → 0 as n → ∞. Definition 2.8. An F -normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E) is said to be uniformly monotone (E ∈ (UM) for short) if for any c > 0, any (xn)∞n=1, (yn)∞n=1 ⊂ E such that 0 ≤ yn ≤ xn, ‖xn‖E ≤ c for any n ∈ N and ‖yn‖E → c, there holds ‖xn − yn‖E → 0 as n → ∞. Definition 2.9. An F -normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E) is said to be orthogonally uniformly monotone (E ∈ (OUM) for short) if for any c > 0, any (xn)∞n=1 ⊂ E+ and any (An)∞n=1 ⊂ Σ such that ‖xn‖E ≤ c for any n ∈ N and ‖xnχAn‖E → c, the condition ‖xn − xnχAn‖E → 0 as n → ∞ holds. Note that if we consider a normed Köthe space (E, ‖.‖E), then Definition 2.8 gives the well known definition of uniform monotonicity (see [3]). Recall also that if E is a normed Köthe space, then E ∈ (SM) if and only if E ∈ (OSM). Similarly, E ∈ (UM) if and only if E ∈ (OUM) (see [17]). Such equivalences needn’t be true if we consider F -normed Köthe spaces. Namely, in F -normed Orlicz spaces properties SM and OSM differ (see Theorems 2.19 and 4.5). The problem if uniform monotonicity differs from orthogonal uniform monotonicity in F -normed Köthe spaces is still unsolved because we have not yet managed to receive complete necessary and sufficient conditions for these properties in F -normed Orlicz spaces. However, from the results of this paper it also follows that, in the case of F -normed Orlicz spaces, properties LLUM and ULUM Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 315 differ from their orthogonal counterparts (see Theorem 4.3 and Corollaries 4.6 and 4.8). Let L0 = L0(I,Σ, μ) be the space of all (equivalence classes of) Lebesgue measurable real-valued functions defined on the interval I, where I = (0, 1) or I = (0,∞). Given any x ∈ L0 we define its distribution function dx : [0,+∞) → [0, μ (I)] by dx(λ) = μ({t ∈ I : |x(t)| > λ}) (see [2,32,35]) and the non-increasing rearrangement x∗ : I → [0,∞] of x as x∗(t) = inf{λ ≥ 0 : dx(λ) ≤ t} (under the convention inf ∅ = ∞). We agree with the notation x∗ (∞) := limt→∞ x∗ (t) . We say that two functions x, y ∈ L0 are equimeasurable if dx(λ) = dy(λ) for all λ ≥ 0. Then we obviously have x∗ = y∗. An F -normed Köthe function space E = (E, ‖.‖E) over the Lebesgue mea- sure space (I,Σ, μ) is called a symmetric function F -space if E is rearrange- ment invariant, which means that if x ∈ E, y ∈ L0 and x∗ = y∗, then y ∈ E and ‖x‖E = ‖y‖E . A symmetric sequence F -space over the counting measure space ( N, 2N, μ ) is defined similarly. The only difference is that the rearrangement x∗ = (x∗(i))∞i=1 of x = (x(i)) ∞ i=1 must be defined in the following way (see [13]): x∗(i) = inf{λ ≥ 0 : dx(λ) < i}. 2.2. F -normed Orlicz spaces Definition 2.10. A function Φ : [0,∞) → [0,∞] is called a monotone Orlicz function if Φ(0) = 0, b(Φ) > 0, Φ is non-decreasing and continuous on the inter- val [0, b(Φ)), limu→b(Φ)− Φ(u) =: Φ(b(Φ)) ∈ (0,∞] and 0 < limu→∞ Φ(u) ≤ ∞, where b(Φ) := sup{u ≥ 0 : Φ(u) < ∞}. We also let a(Φ) := sup{u ≥ 0 : Φ(u) = 0}. Note that a monotone Orlicz function can be neither identically equal to zero nor identically equal to infinity on the interval (0,∞). Any monotone Orlicz function Φ determines a functional IΦ : L0(μ) → [0,∞] defined by the formula IΦ(f) = ∫ Ω Φ(|f(t)|)dμ(t) and called the modu- lar. The order ideal LΦ(μ) = {f ∈ L0(μ) : IΦ(rf) < ∞ for some r > 0} in L0(μ) is called an Orlicz space. The space LΦ(μ) is complete with respect to the following lattice F -norm, called the Mazur–Orlicz F -norm (see [38]): ‖f‖Φ = inf{λ > 0 : IΦ(f/λ) ≤ λ}, (2.1) 316 Y. Cui et al. AEM so it is an F -normed Köthe space, but not a Banach lattice, in general. If Φ is convex, then LΦ(μ), endowed with the equivalent lattice norm (called the Luxemburg norm) ‖f‖Φ = inf{λ > 0 : IΦ(f/λ) ≤ 1}, becomes a Banach lattice. Let us define a lattice ideal EΦ(μ) in LΦ(μ) as EΦ(μ) = {f ∈ L0(μ) : IΦ(rf) < ∞ for all r > 0} (see [31,35–41]). Note that in the case of a non-atomic complete and σ−finite measure space (Ω,Σ, μ) and any monotone Orlicz function Φ both spaces: the space of order continuous elements of the space LΦ(μ) denoted by (LΦ(μ))a and the space EΦ(μ) are non-trivial if and only if b(Φ) = ∞, and they are equal. In the case of the counting measure space, the space (LΦ(μ))a = (�Φ)a is always non-trivial and (�Φ)a = { x ∈ �0 : ∀ λ>0 ∃ nλ∈N ∞∑ n=nλ Φ(λx (n)) < ∞ } =: hΦ cf. [44,45], see also [16, Theorem 6.5]. Definition 2.11. We say that Φ satisfies the Δ2-condition for large arguments (we write shortly Φ ∈ Δ2 (∞)) whenever b(Φ) = ∞ and there are constants K > 0 and u0 > 0 such that Φ(2u) ≤ KΦ(u) for all u ≥ u0. We say that Φ satisfies the Δ2-condition for small arguments (we write shortly Φ ∈ Δ2 (0)) whenever a(Φ) = 0 and there are constants K > 0 and u0 > 0 such that Φ(2u) ≤ KΦ(u) for all u ∈ (0, u0]. We say that Φ satisfies the Δ2-condition for all arguments (we write shortly Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+)) if there is a constant K > 0 such that Φ(2u) ≤ KΦ(u) for all u > 0. Remark 2.12. If Φ is a monotone Orlicz function such that L := lim u→∞ Φ(u) < ∞, then Φ ∈ Δ2(∞). Therefore, if Φ ∈ Δ2(0) and L < ∞, then Φ ∈ Δ2(R+). Proof. Let L < ∞ and take arbitrary u0 > a(Φ). Then, for any u ≥ u0, Φ(2u) ≤ L = L Φ(u0) · Φ(u0) ≤ L Φ(u0) · Φ(u), which means that Φ ∈ Δ2(∞). The second statement of the remark is obvious. � We define Φ ∈ Δ2 (or that Φ satisfies the suitable Δ2-condition) in the following way: (i) Φ ∈ Δ2 (∞) if we consider the Orlicz function space LΦ over a non-atomic and finite measure space, (ii) Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+) if we consider the Orlicz function space LΦ over a non- atomic and infinite measure space, (iii) Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) if we consider the Orlicz sequence space lΦ. Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 317 Remark 2.13. Let l > 1. We say that Φ satisfies the Δl-condition for all argu- ments (we write shortly Φ ∈ Δl (R+)) if there is a constant K > 0 such that Φ(lu) ≤ KΦ(u) for all u > 0. Then the following statements are equivalent: (i) Φ ∈ Δl (R+) for each l > 1; (ii) Φ ∈ Δl (R+) for some l > 1; (iii) Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+). The proof can be done in the same way as for the convex Orlicz function Φ (see [4]). Moreover, we analogously obtain the respective characterization of the condition Δ2 for small (large) arguments. In the case of normed Orlicz spaces the characterization of order continuity is well known. We will see that it is still true for F -normed-Orlicz spaces. Theorem 2.14. Let LΦ (μ) be the F -normed Orlicz function space. Then LΦ (μ) ∈ (OC) (equivalently LΦ (μ) = EΦ (μ)) if and only if Φ ∈ Δ2. Similarly lΦ ∈ (OC) (equivalently lΦ = hΦ) if and only if Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) . Proof. The necessity follows from Theorem 2.5 in [14] (the sequence case) and from Theorem 2.6 in [14] (the function case). On the other hand, it is not difficult to show that if Φ ∈ Δ2 then LΦ = EΦ (lΦ = hΦ), respectively, which can be done in the same way as for normed Orlicz spaces, applying Theorem 6.5 from [16]. � Definition 2.15. Let Φ be a monotone Orlicz function. We say that Φ satisfies the condition Δstr2 (∞) (Φ ∈ Δstr2 (∞) for short) if b(Φ) = ∞ and for any ε > 0 there exist δ > 0 and u0 > 0 such that Φ((1 + δ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀u ≥ u0). (2.2) We say that Φ satisfies the condition Δstr2 (R+) (Φ ∈ Δstr2 (R+) for short) if for any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that Φ((1 + δ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀u ≥ 0). (2.3) We say that Φ satisfies the condition Δstr2 (0) (Φ ∈ Δstr2 (0) for short) if a(Φ) = 0 and for any ε > 0 there exist δ > 0 and u1 > 0 such that Φ((1 + δ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀u ∈ [0, u1]). (2.4) We say that Φ satisfies the suitable Δstr2 -condition if Φ satisfies the Δ str 2 (∞)- condition in the case of the non-atomic finite measure space, the Δstr2 (R+)- condition in the case of the non-atomic infinite (but σ-finite) measure space and the Δstr2 (0)-condition in the case of the counting measure space. Obviously, if a monotone Orlicz function Φ satisfies the suitable Δstr2 - condition, then it also satisfies the suitable Δ2-condition. Note that for a convex Orlicz function the conditions Δstr2 and Δ2 are equivalent (see [4]). However, for non-convex Orlicz functions they needn’t be equivalent as the following example shows. 318 Y. Cui et al. AEM Example. There is a monotone (even strictly increasing) Orlicz function Φ such that Φ ∈ Δ2(∞) and Φ /∈ Δstr2 (∞). Take un = 2n and ε > 0 arbitrarily small. Let Φ (0) = 0,Φ(1) = 1/2, Φ(2) = 1 and let Φ be affine on intervals (0, 1) and (1, 2) . Define Φ ( un ( 1 + 1 2n )) = (1 + ε) Φ (un) for each n = 1, 2, . . . , Φ(un) = (1 + ε) Φ ( un−1 ( 1 + 1 2 (n − 1) )) for any n = 2, 3, . . . . Moreover, let Φ be affine on the intervals ( un, un ( 1 + 1 2n )) and( un−1 ( 1 + 1 2(n−1) ) , un ) . Then Φ ((1 + 1/2n) un) Φ (un) = 1 + ε. Note also that Φ is a strictly increasing Orlicz function. It is easy to see that condition (2.2) is not satisfied. Really, for each δ, u0 > 0, taking n such that 1 + 1/2n < 1 + δ and un > u0, we have Φ (( 1 + 1 2n ) un ) /Φ(un) = 1 + ε, where ε > 0 is fixed and 1 + 1 2n → 0 as n → ∞. On the other hand Φ (2u) ≤ KΦ(u) with K = max { 2, (1 + ε)2 } . Below in the whole section, Φ is a monotone Orlicz function, LΦ(μ) is the Orlicz space equipped with the Mazur–Orlicz F -norm ‖.‖Φ. Let us also recall some auxiliary results. Lemma 2.16. For x ∈ LΦ(μ)\{0}, we have: (i) IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) ≤ ‖x‖Φ, (ii) IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ whenever IΦ ( λ x‖x‖Φ ) < ∞ for some λ > 1. (iii) If IΦ ( x λ ) = λ for λ > 0, then ‖x‖Φ = λ. Proof. For the proof of statements (i) and (ii) we refer to [16, Lemma 6.1]. The proof of statement (iii). By the definition of the F-norm ‖.‖Φ, we have that ‖x‖Φ ≤ λ. Assuming that ‖x‖Φ < λ, by statement (i) of this lemma, we get λ = IΦ (x λ ) ≤ IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) ≤ ‖x‖Φ < λ, a contradiction. � Corollary 2.17. [16, Corollary 6.2] The following statements are true. (i) IΦ(x) ≤ ‖x‖Φ if x ∈ B(LΦ(μ)): (ii) If x ∈ S(LΦ(μ)) and IΦ(λx) < ∞ for some λ > 1, then IΦ(x) = 1: (iii) The equality IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ holds for any x ∈ LΦ(μ)\{0} in the fol- lowing three situations: Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 319 (a) μ is non-atomic, finite and Φ ∈ Δ2(∞) : (b) μ is non-atomic, infinite and Φ ∈ Δ2(R+) : (c) μ is the counting measure on 2N, b(Φ) = ∞ and Φ ∈ Δ2(0). We will need in the sequel the following fact which is not included in the previous corollary (because it was not proved in [16]). Lemma 2.18. Assume that either b(Φ) = ∞ or Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞ when b (Φ) < ∞. Then IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ for each x ∈ hΦ\{0}. Proof. The case b (Φ) = ∞ is evident. Let b (Φ) < ∞ and Φ (b (Φ)) = ∞. We have IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) ≤ ‖x‖Φ , whence x(i) ‖x‖Φ < b (Φ) for each i ∈ N. Since x ∈ hΦ, x ∈ c0. Consequently, 1‖x‖Φ ‖x‖∞ < b (Φ) , whence there is λ0 > 1 such that λ0 ‖x‖Φ ‖x‖∞ < b (Φ) . Thus λ0‖x‖Φ x (i) < b (Φ) for each i ∈ N. Therefore, by the definition of the space hΦ, we conclude that there is n0 = n (λ0) such that ∞∑ n=n0 Φ( λ0‖x‖Φ x (n)) < ∞, so IΦ ( λ0x ‖x‖Φ ) < ∞. Thus IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ , by Lemma 2.16(ii). � Theorem 2.19. Let (Ω,Σ, μ) be a complete, non-atomic σ-finite measure space. Then: (i) The Orlicz space LΦ(μ) is strictly monotone if and only if b(Φ) = ∞, Φ is strictly increasing on R+ and Φ satisfies the condition Δ2(R+) if μ is infinite and the condition Δ2(∞) if μ is finite (see [16, Theorem 6.6]). (ii) If b(Φ) = ∞, the space EΦ(μ) equipped with the Mazur–Orlicz F -norm ‖.‖Φ is strictly monotone if and only if Φ is strictly increasing on R+ (see [16, Corollary 6.7] and [15]). For the sequence spaces �Φ a similar result has been proved in [16], Theorem 6.8. 3. Results on general F-normed Köthe spaces Theorem 3.1. For any F -normed Köthe space E the following assertions are equivalent: (i) E is orthogonally strictly monotone: (ii) for any x, y ∈ E\{0} such that μ(suppx ∩ supp y) = 0 there holds the inequality ‖x + y‖E > max{‖x‖E , ‖y‖E}. Proof. It is obvious that (ii) implies (i). Assume now that (i) holds and x, y ∈ E\{0} are such that μ(suppx ∩ supp y) = 0. Then, ‖x‖E = ‖|x|‖E < ‖|x| + |y|‖E = ‖|x + y|‖E by (i) and, similarly, ‖y‖E = ‖|y|‖E < ‖|x| + |y|‖E = ‖|x + y|‖E , so (ii) holds. � 320 Y. Cui et al. AEM The following result is well known, but we will present its short proof for the sake of completeness. Lemma 3.2. If X,Y are F -normed Köthe spaces and X ⊂ Y then the inclusion operator I : X → Y is continuous. Proof. Although the proof can be found in [42, Theorem 2.7.2, p. 77] (see also [23, Theorem 1.6, p. 10]), we present the details for the reader’s convenience. In view of the closed graph theorem (which is true for F -spaces, see [23, Theorem 1.6, p. 10]) it is enough to show that the inclusion operator I has its graph closed. Assume ‖xn − x0‖X → 0 and ‖Ixn − y0‖Y → 0. We need to prove that y0 = Ix0. Since ‖xn − x0‖X → 0, xn − x0 → 0 μ−a.e. (see [25, Lemma 2, p. 138] , with the same proof for F -normed Köthe spaces, because only the completeness and triangle inequality are important). Similarly, Ixn − y0 → 0 μ−a.e. Thus 0 ≤ |y0 − Ix0| ≤ |y0 − Ixn|+|Ixn − Ix0| = |y0 − Ixn|+|xn − x0| → 0 μ−a.e., which ends the proof. � Lemma 3.3. Let E be a symmetric function F -space over I = (0,∞). If x ∈ Ea, then x∗ (∞) = 0. Proof. Recall that for each symmetric function F -space we have E ⊂ L∞ + Lfin, where Lfin = { x ∈ L0 : m (suppx) < ∞ } and L∞ + Lfin = { x ∈ L0 : x = y + z and y ∈ L∞, z ∈ Lfin } is a symmetric function F -space with the F -norm ‖x‖L∞+Lfin = inf { ‖y‖∞ + m (supp z) : x = y + z and y ∈ L∞, z ∈ Lfin } (see [18, Theorem 1]). Moreover, since E and L∞+Lfin are complete F -normed function spaces, by Lemma 3.2, the inclusion operator I : E → L∞ + Lfin is continuous. Assume that a := x∗ (∞) > 0. Denoting A = {t ∈ I : |x (t)| ≥ a/2} we have m (A) = ∞. We find a sequence (An) of pairwise disjoint sets with An ⊂ A and m (An) = ∞ and set xn = xχAn . For each partition xn = yn + zn with yn ∈ L∞ and zn ∈ Lfin we have ‖yn‖∞ ≥ a/2. Thus ‖xn‖L∞+Lfin ≥ a/2. If ‖xn‖E → 0 then we would get ‖Ixn‖L∞+Lfin → 0, because the operator I is continuous, which is a contradiction. It means that ‖xn‖E → 0 as n → ∞, whence x /∈ Ea. This finishes the proof. � Proposition 3.4. Let E be a symmetric function F -space over I = (0,∞) with E ∈ (FP ). If E ∈ (Hl) , then E ∈ (Hg) , E ∈ (OC) and E ∈ (OSM) . Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 321 Proof. Obviously, we need only to show that if E ∈ (Hl) then E ∈ (OC) and E ∈ (OSM) . Suppose E /∈ (OC) . Then there is x ∈ E and a sequence 0 ≤ xn ≤ |x| such that xn → 0 a.e. and ‖xn‖E � 0. Taking yn = |x| − xn we get 0 ≤ yn ≤ |x| and yn → |x| a.e., whence, by the Fatou property of E, ‖x‖E ≤ lim infn→∞ ‖yn‖E (see [2, Lemma 1.5, p. 5]). On the other hand, lim inf n→∞ ‖yn‖E ≤ lim sup n→∞ ‖yn‖E ≤ ‖x‖E , whence ‖yn‖E → ‖x‖E . Moreover, since the measure is σ-finite, passing to a subsequence if necessary, we conclude that yn → |x| locally in measure. Finally, ‖yn − |x|‖E = ‖xn‖E � 0. It means that E /∈ (Hl) . Assume that E /∈ (OSM) . Then there is an element x ∈ E+ and a mea- surable set A ∈ Σ ∩ suppx such that m (A) > 0 and ‖x‖E = ∥ ∥xχI\A ∥ ∥ E . We may assume that 0 < m (A) < 1. Let J = ∪∞n=1(2n − 2, 2n − 1] and σ be a measure preserving transformation from J onto I (see [43]) and let us define y (t) = (xχA) (σ (t)) and z (t) = ( xχI\A ) (σ (t)) for t ∈ J. Then m (supp y ∩ supp z) = 0 and m (supp y) < 1. Define yn (t) = { y∗ (t − (2n − 1)) if t > 2n − 1, 0 if 0 < t ≤ 2n − 1, and zn = z + yn. Then, by the symmetry of E, ‖zn‖E = ‖x‖E = ∥ ∥xχI\A ∥ ∥ E = ‖z‖E and ‖zn − z‖E = ‖yn‖E = ‖y‖E = ‖xχA‖E > 0. Clearly, zn → z locally in measure. Thus E /∈ (Hl) . � Question Can the implication from Proposition 3.4 be reversed? It is known that for symmetric Banach function spaces the following characterization is true: E ∈ (Hl) if and only if E ∈ (Hg) , E ∈ (OC) and E ∈ (SM) (see [8, Corollary 3.15]). It seems that some methods from [8] may be useful. Recall that in the counting measure, convergence globally (locally) in mea- sure is just the uniform (coordinatewise) convergence and the property Hg (Hl) is then denoted by Hu (Hc). Similarly to the above Proposition, one can prove the following Proposition 3.5. Let E be a symmetric F -normed sequence space with the Fatou property. If E ∈ (Hc) , then E ∈ (Hu) , E ∈ (OC) and E ∈ (OSM) . Lemma 3.6. Let E be an F -normed function (sequence) space. Then E ∈ (Hl) (E ∈ (Hc)) if and only if E+ ∈ (Hl) (E+ ∈ (Hc)). 322 Y. Cui et al. AEM Proof. Clearly, we need only to prove the sufficiency. First notice that if E+ ∈ (Hl) then E+ ∈ (OC) , see the proof of Proposition 3.4. Then the conclusion follows from Proposition 1 in [19] (the proof for F -lattices is the same as for Banach lattices). � 4. Results on F-normed Orlicz-spaces In a natural way we are going to consider below the following three cases of the measure space (Ω,Σ, μ): – μ is non-atomic and finite, – μ is non-atomic and infinite, – μ is the counting measure. Note that in all these cases the Orlicz space LΦ(μ) is symmetric. Thus we restrict ourselves for simplicity to the cases (see [32,35]): – μ is the Lebesgue measure on the interval Ω := (0, α), where α = 1 or α = ∞ (the case of the Orlicz function space LΦ(μ)), – μ is the counting measure on ( N, 2N, μ ) (the case of the Orlicz sequence space lΦ). We will use the symbol μ in all these cases because it will not cause any misunderstanding. Unless otherwise stated, in the whole section: – Φ is a monotone Orlicz function on R+, – Φ(b(Φ)) := limu→b(Φ)− Φ(u), – LΦ(μ) is an F -normed Orlicz function space equipped with the Mazur– Orlicz F -norm ‖ · ‖Φ, – EΦ (μ) is the subspace of order continuous elements in LΦ(μ) with the Mazur–Orlicz F -norm ‖ · ‖Φ induced from LΦ(μ), – we consider the sequence spaces lΦ and hΦ (the subspace of order con- tinuous elements in �Φ) with the Mazur–Orlicz F -norm ‖ · ‖Φ. Lemma 4.1. (i) For any x ∈ EΦ(μ) the function fx(λ) = IΦ(λx) is continuous on the interval (0,∞) and right-continuous at 0. (ii) Assume that b(Φ) = ∞ or Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞ whenever b (Φ) < ∞. Then for any x ∈ hΦ the function fx(λ) = IΦ(λx) is continuous at each point λ0 ∈ (0, b (Φ)) satisfying fx(λ0) < ∞. Proof. (i) Take any λ0 ∈ [0,∞) and any sequence (λn)∞n=1 in [0,∞) such that λn → λ0 as n → ∞. Then, there exists a constant α > 0 such that 0 ≤ λn ≤ α for any n ∈ N. In consequence, 0 ≤ Φ(λn|x(t)|) ≤ Φ(α|x(t)|) for all n ∈ N and μ−a.e. t ∈ Ω. Since x ∈ EΦ(μ), we have Φ ◦ α|x| ∈ L1(Ω). By the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we obtain f(λn) = IΦ(λnx) → IΦ(λ0x) = f(λ0) Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 323 as n → ∞, and the proof is finished. (ii) We consider only the case b (Φ) < ∞ and Φ (b (Φ)) = ∞, because in the case b (Φ) = ∞ the proof is simpler. Let x ∈ hΦ, λ0 ∈ (0, b (Φ)) and a sequence (λn)∞n=1 ⊂ (0, b (Φ)) be such that fx(λ0) < ∞ and λn → λ0 as n → ∞. Since x ∈ hΦ, x ∈ c0 (see Lemma 2.18). Thus λ0‖x‖∞ = λ0x (i0) < b (Φ) for some i0 ∈ N. Take α > 0 such that αx (i0) ∈ (λ0x (i0) , b (Φ)) . Then, there is n0 ∈ N such that 0 ≤ Φ(λn|x(i)|) ≤ Φ(α|x(i)|) for all n ≥ n0 and i ∈ N. Applying the assumption that x ∈ hΦ, we find a number i = i (α) such that ∞∑ i=i(α) Φ(αx (i)) < ∞. Thus Φ ◦ α|x| ∈ l1 and we can finish the proof in the same way as in case (i) . � Recall that if b(Φ) < ∞ then EΦ(μ) = {0} . Thus the assumption b(Φ) = ∞ in the theorem presented below is natural. Note also that the theorem presented below is an extension of Theorem 2.19(ii) . Theorem 4.2. Assume that b(Φ) = ∞. Then the following conditions are equiv- alent. (i) EΦ(μ) is lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) EΦ(μ) is strictly monotone. (iii) Φ is strictly increasing on R+. Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) is obvious. In virtue of Theorem 2.19(ii), we have that (ii) ⇔ (iii) . Thus, we only need to prove that (iii) implies (i). In order to do it, assume that 0 ≤ xn ≤ x ∈ EΦ+(μ)\{0} and ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ as n → ∞. We need to prove that ‖xn − x‖Φ → 0 as n → ∞. We have that IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) = ‖xn‖Φ for any n ∈ N and IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ (see Lemma 2.16), whence, by the assumption that ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ as n → ∞, we obtain IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) → IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) (4.1) as n → ∞. Furthermore, by Lemma 4.1(i), IΦ ( x ‖xn‖Φ ) → IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) as n → ∞, which together with the previous condition gives IΦ ( x ‖xn‖Φ ) − IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) → 0 (4.2) as n → ∞. Since Φ ◦ xn‖xn‖Φ ≤ Φ ◦ x ‖xn‖Φ , condition (4.2) implies that ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥Φ ◦ x ‖xn‖Φ − Φ ◦ xn‖xn‖Φ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ L1(Ω) = IΦ ( x ‖xn‖Φ ) − IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) → 0 (4.3) as n → ∞. Consequently, the sequence {Φ ◦ x‖xn‖Φ − Φ ◦ xn ‖xn‖Φ } ∞ n=1 converges to zero in measure. By the σ-finiteness of the measure μ, we obtain that there exists a strictly increasing sequence {nk}∞k=1 in N such that the sequence {Φ ◦ 324 Y. Cui et al. AEM x ‖xnk ‖Φ −Φ◦ xnk‖xnk ‖Φ } ∞ k=1 converges to zero μ−a.e.. Hence, the assumption that Φ is strictly increasing and continuous on R+ implies that { x‖xnk ‖Φ − xnk ‖xnk ‖Φ }∞k=1 converges to zero μ−a.e.. This implies that {x − xnk}∞k=1 converges to zero μ−a.e.. Let us take an arbitrary λ > 0. Then Φ ◦ λ (x − xnk) → 0 (4.4) as k → ∞ μ−a.e. in Ω. Clearly, Φ ◦ λ(x − xnk) ≤ Φ ◦ λx ∈ L1(Ω), (4.5) because x ∈ EΦ+(μ). Conditions (4.4), (4.5) and the Lebesgue dominated con- vergence theorem imply that IΦ(λ(x − xnk)) → 0 as k → ∞ for any λ > 0. In consequence, ‖x−xnk‖Φ → 0 as k → ∞ (see [16, Lemma 6.4]). Finally, by the double extract subsequence theorem, we finish the proof. � The following theorem is an extension of Theorem 2.19(i) . Moreover, the assumption below that b(Φ) = ∞ does not diminish the generality because if b(Φ) < ∞ then none of the conditions (i)–(iv) is satisfied and EΦ(μ) = {0} . Theorem 4.3. If b(Φ) = ∞, the following conditions are equivalent. (i) LΦ(μ) is lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) LΦ(μ) is upper locally uniformly monotone. (iii) LΦ(μ) is strictly monotone. (iv) Φ is strictly increasing and Φ satisfies the suitable Δ2-condition. (v) EΦ(μ) is upper locally uniformly monotone. Proof. Applying Theorem 2.19(i) we get (i) ⇒ (iii) ⇔ (iv) . Moreover, if Φ ∈ Δ2, then EΦ(μ) = LΦ(μ). Thus (iv) ⇒ (i), by Theorem 4.2. Moreover, (ii) ⇒ (iii) ⇒ (iv) . Consequently, we need only to prove the implication (iv) ⇒ (ii) and that (v) is equivalent to any of the conditions (i) − (iv). First, we will prove that (iv) ⇒ (ii). Let 0 ≤ x ≤ xn ∈ LΦ(μ) for any n ∈ N and lim n→∞ ‖xn‖Φ = ‖x‖Φ, where x = 0. Since Φ ∈ Δ2, we conclude that IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) = ‖xn‖Φ and IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ, so IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) − IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) → 0 as n → ∞. By Φ ∈ Δ2, we have EΦ(μ) = LΦ(μ). Thus, applying Lemma 4.1(i), we obtain that IΦ ( x ‖xn‖Φ ) → IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ as n → ∞. Consequently, 0 ≤ IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) − IΦ ( x ‖xn‖Φ ) → 0 as n → ∞. This means that ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥Φ ◦ xn ‖xn‖Φ − Φ ◦ x‖xn‖Φ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ L1(Ω) → 0 (4.6) Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 325 as n → ∞. Therefore, there exist a strictly increasing sequence {nk}∞k=1 of natural numbers, a sequence of positive numbers {εk}∞k=1 ∈ (0, 1) and y ∈ L1+(Ω) such that lim k→∞ εk = 0 and 0 ≤ Φ ◦ xnk‖xnk‖Φ − Φ ◦ x‖xnk‖Φ ≤ εky (k ∈ N) (see [25]), (4.7) whence Φ ◦ xnk‖xnk‖Φ ≤ εky + Φ ◦ x ‖xnk‖Φ ≤ y + Φ ◦ x‖x‖Φ . (4.8) From condition (4.7), we conclude that Φ ◦ xnk‖xnk‖Φ − Φ ◦ x‖xnk‖Φ → 0 μ − a.e.. Since Φ is strictly increasing, xnk ‖xnk‖Φ − x‖xnk‖Φ → 0 μ−a.e., whence Φ ◦ ( xnk ‖xnk‖Φ − x‖xnk‖Φ ) → 0 μ − a.e.. Moreover, by (4.8), Φ ◦ ( xnk ‖xnk‖Φ − x‖xnk‖Φ ) ≤ Φ ◦ ( xnk ‖xnk‖Φ ) ≤ y + Φ ◦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) ∈ L1. Note that ‖xnk‖Φ ≤ 2‖x‖Φ for k large enough. By L1 ∈ (OC) we conclude that 0 ≤ IΦ ( xnk − x 2‖x‖Φ ) ≤ IΦ ( xnk − x ‖xnk‖Φ ) → 0 as k → ∞. By the suitable Δ2-condition, we can hence easily get that IΦ(λ(xnk −x)) → 0 as k → ∞ for any λ > 0, which means that ‖xnk −x‖Φ → 0 as k → ∞. By the double extract subsequence theorem, we obtain that ‖xn − x‖Φ → 0 as n → ∞. Now, we will prove that condition (v) is equivalent to any of the conditions (i)–(iv) . Clearly, condition (iv) gives the equality EΦ(μ) = LΦ(μ) and con- dition (ii) implies that EΦ(μ) ∈ (ULUM) . Conversely, if EΦ(μ) ∈ (ULUM) then EΦ(μ) ∈ (SM) , whence Φ is strictly increasing, by Theorem 2.19(ii) . Thus it is enough to show that if EΦ(μ) ∈ (ULUM) then Φ ∈ Δ2. We divide the proof into two cases. (a) Let Ω = (0, 1), b(Φ) = ∞ and Φ /∈ Δ2(∞). Then for each l > 1, Φ /∈ Δl(∞) (see Remark 2.13). Consequently, there exists a sequence {un}∞n=1 of positive numbers such that un ≥ n and Φ (( 1 + 1 n ) un ) > 2nΦ(un) for any n ∈ N. Let us take an arbitrary set A ∈ Σ such that μ(A) > 0 and μ(Ω\A) > 0. Next, choose in Ω\A a sequence {Bn}∞n=1 of measurable and pairwise disjoint sets of positive measure (we can even assume that μ(Bn) = 2−nμ(Ω\A) for every n ∈ N). Take n1 ∈ N such that Φ(un1)μ(B1) ≥ 12 and choose a measur- able subset C1 of B1 such that Φ(un1)μ(C1) = 1 2 . Next, we can find n2 > n1, n2 ∈ N, such that Φ(un2)μ(B2) ≥ 14 and let us choose a measurable subset C2 326 Y. Cui et al. AEM of B2 such that Φ(un2)μ(C2) = 1 4 . Continuing this procedure, we can find, by induction, a strictly increasing sequence {nk}∞k=1 of natural numbers and a se- quence of measurable sets {Ck}∞k=1 such that Ck ⊂ Bk and Φ(unk)μ(Ck) = 2−k for all k ∈ N. Define yk = unkχCk (∀ k ∈ N). Then, yk ∈ EΦ(μ), IΦ(yk) = 2−k for any k ∈ N and IΦ (( 1 + 1 nk ) yk ) = Φ (( 1 + 1 nk ) unk ) μ(Ck) > 2nkΦ(unk)μ(Ck) = 2nk · 2−k ≥ 1, whence ∥ ∥ ∥ ( 1 + 1 nk ) yk ∥ ∥ ∥ Φ ≥ 1. Therefore, by the triangle inequality, ‖2yk‖Φ ≥ 1 and ‖yk‖Φ ≥ 12 for any k ∈ N. Let a ∈ R+ be such that Φ(a)μ(A) = 1. Then x := aχA ∈ EΦ(μ) and IΦ(x) = 1, whence ‖x‖Φ = 1. Let us define xk = x + yk for any k ∈ N. Then xk ∈ EΦ(μ), 0 ≤ x ≤ xk and IΦ(xk) = IΦ(x) + IΦ(yk) = 1 + 2−k for every k ∈ N. Hence, 1 = ‖x‖Φ ≤ ‖xk‖Φ ≤ 1 + 2−k for all k ∈ N, so ‖xk‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ, as k → ∞. Simultaneously, ‖xk − x‖Φ = ‖yk‖Φ ≥ 12 for all k ∈ N, which means that EΦ(μ) is not upper locally uni- formly monotone. (b) Assume that Ω = (0,∞), b(Φ) = ∞ and Φ /∈ Δ2(R+). It means that Φ /∈ Δ2(∞) or Φ /∈ Δ2(0). In the first case we follow as in (a) . If Φ /∈ Δ2(0) then we may also repeat the above proof analogously with suitably changed sequences (unk) and (Ck) (see [14]). � Remark 4.4. In order to prove that the statements (i)-(iv) in Theorem 4.3 are equivalent, we need not assume that b(Φ) = ∞. In Theorem 4.3 we assumed that b(Φ) = ∞ in order to have that EΦ(μ) = {0}. From Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 it follows that properties (LLUM) and (ULUM) are not equivalent in general. Theorem 4.5. If b(Φ) = ∞, the following conditions are equivalent. (i) EΦ(μ) is orthogonally lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) EΦ(μ) is orthogonally strictly monotone. (iii) a(Φ) = 0. Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) is clear. Let us prove the implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) . Assume that a(Φ) > 0. Let A,B ∈ Σ be such that 0 < μ(A) < ∞, B ⊂ Ω\A and 0 < μ(B) < ∞. Take any x ∈ EΦ+(μ)\ {0} with suppx ⊆ A and Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 327 define y = x + a(Φ)‖x‖ΦχB. Then 0 ≤ x ≤ y ∈ EΦ+(μ), so ‖x‖Φ ≤ ‖y‖Φ. On the other hand IΦ ( y ‖x‖Φ ) = IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ, whence ‖y‖Φ ≤ ‖x‖Φ. Therefore, ‖x‖Φ = ‖y‖Φ. Since x = y, we proved that EΦ(μ) is not orthogonally strictly monotone if a(Φ) > 0, and our implication is proved. Let us now prove the implication (iii) ⇒ (i) . Assume that x ∈ EΦ+(μ)\{0} and (An)∞n=1 is a sequence in Σ such that ‖xχAn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ as n → ∞. We need to show that ‖x−xχAn‖Φ = ‖xχΩ\An‖Φ → 0 as n → ∞. By Lemmas 2.16 and 4.1 (see conditions (4.1)–(4.3) in the proof of Theorem 4.2), we conclude that ‖Φ◦xχΩ\An‖L1 → 0 , whence xχΩ\An → 0 as n → ∞ in measure (because a(Φ) = 0). In consequence, by the assumption that the measure μ is σ-finite, passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we can assume that xχΩ\An → 0 as n → ∞ μ−a.e. in Ω. Let us take an arbitrary λ > 0. Note that Φ ◦λxχΩ\An ≤ Φ ◦ λx ∈ L1, because x ∈ EΦ+(μ). Moreover, Φ ◦ λxχΩ\An → 0 as n → ∞ μ-a.e. in Ω. Consequently, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,∥ ∥Φ ◦ λxχΩ\An ∥ ∥ L1 → 0. It means that ∥ ∥xχΩ\An ∥ ∥ Φ → 0 as n → ∞, which finishes the proof. � Corollary 4.6. The following conditions are equivalent. (i) LΦ(μ) is orthogonally lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) LΦ(μ) is orthogonally strictly monotone. (iii) a(Φ) = 0 and Φ satisfies the suitable Δ2-condition. Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) is clear. Let us prove the implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) . Assuming that condition (ii) holds, the condition a(Φ) = 0 follows from Theorem 4.5. The conditions b(Φ) = ∞ and Φ ∈ Δ2 follow directly from the proof of the necessity part of Theorem 6.6 in [16], so we omit the details here. Finally, if Φ ∈ Δ2, then EΦ(μ) = LΦ(μ). Thus (iii) ⇒ (i) by Theorem 4.5. � Theorem 4.7. Assume that b(Φ) = ∞. Then EΦ(μ) is orthogonally upper lo- cally uniformly monotone if and only if a(Φ) = 0 and Φ ∈ Δ2. Proof. Necessity. The condition a(Φ) = 0 follows from Theorem 4.5. In the proof of Theorem 4.3 we have proved in fact that if Φ /∈ Δ2 then EΦ(μ) /∈ (OULUM) . Sufficiency. Let x ∈ EΦ+\{0} be such that μ(Ω\ supp x) > 0. Take a se- quence (xn) in EΦ+ with suppxn ⊂ Ω\ supp x and ‖x + xn‖E → ‖x‖E . We will show that ‖xn‖E → 0. Similarly as in the proof of Theorem 4.2 (con- ditions (4.1)–(4.3) in the proof), we get IΦ ( x+xn ‖x+xn‖Φ ) → IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) and IΦ ( x ‖x+xn‖Φ ) → IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) , whence IΦ ( x+xn ‖x+xn‖Φ ) −IΦ ( x ‖x+xn‖Φ ) → 0. This 328 Y. Cui et al. AEM gives that IΦ ( xn ‖x+xn‖Φ ) → 0, because xn, x have pairwise orthogonal sup- ports. Analogously as in the proof of Theorem 4.3 we find a subsequence (xnk) of (xn) , a sequence (εk) with 0 < εk → 0 and an element y ∈ L1+ (Ω) such that Φ ◦ ( xnk 2‖x‖Φ ) ≤ Φ ◦ ( xnk ‖x+xnk ‖Φ ) ≤ εky for k large enough. Consequently, we obtain that IΦ ( xnk 2‖x‖Φ ) → 0. By Φ ∈ Δ2, we have ‖xnk‖Φ → 0. Using the double extract subsequence theorem, we finish the proof. � Corollary 4.8. The following conditions are equivalent. (i) LΦ(μ) is orthogonally upper locally uniformly monotone. (ii) LΦ(μ) is orthogonally strictly monotone. (iii) a(Φ) = 0, b(Φ) = ∞ and Φ ∈ Δ2. Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) is clear, the implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) follows from Corollary 4.6. Finally, if Φ ∈ Δ2 then EΦ(μ) = LΦ(μ) and we can apply the previous theorem. � Theorem 4.9. The following statements are equivalent. (i) hΦ is orthogonally lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) hΦ is orthogonally strictly monotone. (iii) a(Φ) = 0 and either a) b(Φ) = ∞ or b) b (Φ) < ∞ and Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞. Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) is obvious. Let us prove the implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) . Suppose a(Φ) > 0. Let x = (a(Φ) + 1, a(Φ), a(Φ), 0, 0, . . .), y = xχN\{2} and denote Φ(a(Φ)+1) = c. Of course c > 0 and IΦ(x) = IΦ(y) = c, which can be rewritten in the form IΦ ( cx c ) = IΦ ( cy c ) = c . Thus, ‖cx‖Φ = ‖cy‖Φ = c, whence by x = y, we obtain that hΦ is not orthogonally strictly monotone. We have to show that if hΦ is orthogonally strictly monotone then Φ (b (Φ)) = ∞ if b (Φ) < ∞. Assuming that b(Φ) < ∞ and Φ (b (Φ)) < ∞, define x = b(Φ)e1, y = b(Φ)e1 + b(Φ)e2 and denote α = Φ(b(Φ)) for short. Then IΦ(y) = 2α , whence IΦ ( 2αy 2α ) = 2α, so ‖2αy‖Φ = 2α. Next, IΦ(x) = α, so IΦ ( 2αx 2α ) = α < 2α. Therefore, ‖2αx‖Φ ≤ 2α. However, IΦ ( 2αx λ2α ) = IΦ (x λ ) = Φ ( b(Φ) λ ) = ∞ > λ2α for any λ ∈ (0, 1), whence ‖2αx‖Φ ≥ 2λα. By the arbitrariness of λ ∈ (0, 1), we get ‖2αx‖Φ ≥ 2α, so ‖2αx‖Φ = 2α. Therefore, 2αx ≤ 2αy, 2αx = 2αy (in fact 2αx = 2αyχ{1}) and ‖2αx‖Φ = ‖2αy‖Φ. It means that the space (hΦ, ‖.‖Φ) is not orthogonally strictly monotone, which finishes the proof of the implication b(Φ) < ∞ ⇒ Φ(b(Φ)) = ∞. Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 329 The implication (iii) ⇒ (i). We follow similarly as in the proof of Theorem 4.5, applying additionally Lemmas 2.18 and 4.1(ii). However, we explain how one can conclude in the last part of the proof that IΦ ( λxχN\Ank ) → 0 for each λ > 0. Let us take arbitrary λ, ε > 0. Since x ∈ hΦ, there is iλ = i (λ) such that ∑∞ i=iλ Φ(λx (i)) < ∞. Note that Φ ◦ ( λxχN\Ank ) → 0 coordi- natewise. Consequently, there is k1 ∈ N such that ∑iλ i=1 Φ ( λxχN\Ank (i) ) < ε/2 for k ≥ k1. Furthermore, for N0 = {iλ + 1, iλ + 2, . . .} , we have Φ ◦( λxχ(N\Ank )∩N0 ) ≤ Φ ◦ (λxχN0) ∈ l1. Thus, since l1 ∈ (OC) , there is k2 ∈ N such that ∞∑ i=iλ+1 Φ ( λxχN\Ank (i) ) < ε/2 for k ≥ k2, whence IΦ ( λxχN\Ank ) = iλ∑ i=1 Φ ( λxχN\Ank (i) ) + ∞∑ i=iλ+1 Φ ( λxχN\Ank (i) ) < ε for k ≥ max {k1, k2} . � Corollary 4.10. The following statements are equivalent. (i) lΦ is orthogonally lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) lΦ is orthogonally strictly monotone. (iii) Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) and either a) b(Φ) = ∞ or b) b (Φ) < ∞ and Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞. Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) is obvious. Now, we will show the implica- tion (ii) ⇒ (iii). The necessity of the alternative a) or b) in condition (iii) for condition (ii) is an immediate consequence of the proof of the necessity of the alternative of condition (ii) from Theorem 4.9. Therefore, based on the previ- ous theorem we need only to prove that Φ ∈ Δ2(0) is necessary for condition (ii). If a(Φ) > 0, then �Φ contains an order isometric copy of �∞ [14, Theorem 2.5 (ii)], so it is not orthogonally strictly monotone. Assuming that a(Φ) = 0 and Φ /∈ Δ2(0) and applying the proof of Theorem 6.8 in [16] one can find an element x ∈ E+\{0} and a set A ∈ Σ ∩ suppx with μ(A) > 0 such that ‖xχN\A‖E = ‖x‖E . Thus (lΦ, ‖.‖Φ) is not orthogonally strictly monotone. Sufficiency. The condition Φ ∈ Δ2(0) gives that lΦ = hΦ (see Theorem 2.14). So, it is enough to apply the previous theorem. � The following two results are essential extensions of Theorem 6.8 from [16], which has been proved under the general assumption that b (Φ) = ∞. We will show below that the result of that theorem remains true under some weaker condition than b (Φ) = ∞ and that this condition is necessary. We will also prove that property SM is equivalent to LLUM. Theorem 4.11. The following conditions are equivalent. (i) hΦ is lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) hΦ is strictly monotone. 330 Y. Cui et al. AEM (iii) Φ is strictly increasing on (0, b (Φ)) and either b (Φ) = ∞ or b (Φ) < ∞ and Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞. Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) is clear. Let us prove the implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) . To prove that Φ is strictly increasing we follow in the same way as in the proof of the necessity part of Theorem 6.8 from [16], see also the proof of Theorem 4.9 when a (Φ) > 0. The last statement follows from Theorem 4.9. Now, we will prove the implication (iii) ⇒ (i) . The proof can be done analogously as that of the implication (iii) ⇒ (i) in Theorem 4.2, by applying Lemma 2.18 and Lemma 4.1(ii). Note also that in the last part of the proof we should apply the techniques from the proof of Theorem 4.9, (iii) ⇒ (i) (the problem of the existence of a majorant in l1). � Corollary 4.12. The following conditions are equivalent: (i) lΦ is lower locally uniformly monotone. (ii) lΦ is strictly monotone. (iii) Φ is strictly increasing on (0, b(Φ)), Φ ∈ Δ2(0) and either b (Φ) = ∞ or b (Φ) < ∞ and Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞. (iv) lΦ is upper locally uniformly monotone. (v) hΦ is upper locally uniformly monotone. Proof. The fact that (i) implies (ii) and (iv) implies (v) is obvious. Apply- ing the previous theorem and Corollary 4.10, we conclude the implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) . Finally, if Φ ∈ Δ2(0) then hΦ = lΦ, so by the previous theorem, (iii) ⇒ (i) . We will show that (iii) implies (iv). Let 0 ≤ x ≤ xn ∈ �Φ for any n ∈ N and ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ as n → ∞. Proceeding analogously as in the proof of Theorem 4.3 (the implication (iv) ⇒ (ii)), and applying Lemma 4.1(ii) and Corollary 2.17, we can finish the proof. Now we will prove that (v) implies (iii). By Theorem 4.11 we need only to prove that Φ ∈ Δ2(0) is necessary for (v). Since Φ must be strictly increasing, a(Φ) = 0. Suppose that Φ /∈ Δ2(0). Therefore, by Remark 2.13, there exists a sequence {un}∞n=1 of positive numbers such that 0 < Φ(un) ≤ 2−(n+1) and Φ (( 1 + 1 n ) un ) > 2n+1Φ(un) for any n ∈ N. Let kn ∈ N be the biggest natural number such that knΦ(un) ≤ 2−n. Then, by Φ(un) ≤ 2−(n+1), we have 2−(n+1) ≤ knΦ(un) ≤ 2−n (∀ n ∈ N). Define yn = kn∑ i=1 une2i+1. Then IΦ(yn) ≤ 2−n and IΦ (( 1 + 1 n ) yn ) ≥ 2n+1IΦ(yn) > 2n+1 · 2−(n+1) = 1 , whence ‖ ( 1 + 1 n ) yn‖Φ ≥ 1. Therefore, ‖2yn‖Φ ≥ 1 and, by the tri- angle inequality for the F-norm ‖.‖Φ, we get that ‖yn‖Φ ≥ 12 for any n ∈ N. Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 331 Denote limu→∞ Φ(u) = a. Let u0 > 0 be such that Φ(u0) = 12 min{1, a}. Let k be the biggest natural number such that kΦ(u0) < 1. Then (k + 1)Φ(u0) ≥ 1. Consequently, there exists u1 ∈ (0, u0] such that kΦ(u0)+Φ(u1) = 1. Defining x = k∑ i=1 u0e2i + u1e2(k+1), we get IΦ(x) = 1, whence ‖x‖Φ = 1. Let us define xn = x + yn (∀ n ∈ N). It is obvious that all xn and x belong to hΦ. Since xn ≥ x , ‖xn‖Φ ≥ ‖x‖Φ for any n ∈ N. On the other hand, since the supports of x and yn are disjoint, we obtain IΦ ( xn 1 + 2−n ) ≤ IΦ(xn) = IΦ(x) + IΦ(yn) ≤ 1 + 2−n (∀ n ∈ N), whence ‖xn‖Φ ≤ 1 + 2−n for any n ∈ N. Consequently, ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ as n → ∞. Simultaneously, ‖xn − x‖Φ = ‖yn‖Φ ≥ 12 for any n ∈ N. This shows that the space hΦ is not orthogonally upper locally uniformly monotone, so it is not upper locally uniformly monotone either. � Theorem 4.13. The following conditions are equivalent. (i) Φ satisfies the Δ2(0)-condition and either b (Φ) = ∞ or b (Φ) < ∞ and Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞. (ii) �Φ is orthogonally upper locally uniformly monotone. (iii) hΦ is orthogonally upper locally uniformly monotone. Proof. The implication (ii) ⇒ (iii) is obvious. The implication (iii) ⇒ (i) follows from Theorem 4.9 and from the proof of Corollary 4.12, where it was proved that if Φ /∈ Δ2(0), then hΦ is not orthogonally upper locally uniformly monotone. So, we need only to prove that (i) implies (ii). Assume that condi- tion (i) holds, x ∈ �Φ+\{0} and (xn)∞n=1 in �Φ+ is such that suppx∩ suppxn = ∅ for any n ∈ N and ‖x + xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ as n → ∞. We can assume that ‖x + xn‖Φ ≤ 2‖x‖Φ for any n ∈ N. By Lemmas 2.16 and 2.18 we know that IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ and IΦ ( x + xn ‖x + xn‖Φ ) = ‖x + xn‖Φ (n ∈ N). In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 4.7, we obtain that IΦ ( xnk 2‖x‖Φ ) → 0 as k → ∞ for some subsequence (xnk) of (xn). Therefore, for k large enough, we have IΦ ( xnk 2‖x‖Φ ) ≤ Φ(u0), where u0 is the constant from the definition of condition Δ2(0). Hence, 0 ≤ xnk (i)2‖x‖Φ ≤ u0 for all i ∈ N and for k ∈ N large enough. By the Δ2(0)−condition, we get IΦ ( 2xnk 2‖x‖Φ ) ≤ KIΦ ( xnk 2‖x‖Φ ) for k ∈ N large enough. By induction, we obtain that for any natural l, IΦ ( 2lxnk 2‖x‖Φ ) ≤ 332 Y. Cui et al. AEM KlIΦ ( xnk 2‖x‖Φ ) for all k ∈ N large enough. This yields that IΦ(λxnk) → 0 as k → ∞ for any λ > 0, that is, ‖xnk‖Φ → 0 as k → ∞, and by the double extract subsequence theorem, ‖xn‖Φ → 0 as n → ∞, that is, �Φ is OULUM. � Lemma 4.14. Assume that Φ is strictly increasing on R+. Then Φ ∈ Δstr2 (∞) if and only if for any u1 > 0 and each ε > 0 there exists σ = σ (ε, u1) > 0 such that Φ((1 + σ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀ u ≥ u1). (4.9) Proof. We only need to prove that the Δstr2 (∞)-condition implies condition (4.9). Let us take arbitrary u1, ε > 0. Take u0 = u0 (ε) and δ = δ (ε) from Definition 2.15. If u1 ≥ u0, then we have nothing to prove, so assume that u1 < u0. We will explain condition Δstr2 (∞) in terms of the inverse function Φ−1. Let u ≥ u0 and v = Φ(u). Then Φ−1(v) = u ≥ u0 and v ≥ Φ(u0). Applying Definition 2.15, we get Φ((1 + δ)Φ−1(v)) ≤ (1 + ε)v (∀ v ≥ Φ(u0)). (4.10) Acting both sides in (4.10) with Φ−1, we get the equivalent condition (1 + δ)Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ≥ Φ(u0)). (4.11) It is obvious that by the continuity of the function f(v) = Φ−1((1 + ε)v) Φ−1(v) on the interval [Φ(u1),Φ(u0)], there exists v̄ ∈ [Φ(u1),Φ(u0)] such that infv∈[Φ(u1),Φ(u0)] f(v) = f(v̄). Consequently, Φ−1((1 + ε)v) Φ−1(v) ≥ f(v̄) (∀ v ∈ [Φ(u1),Φ(u0)]), that is, f(v̄)Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ∈ [Φ(u1),Φ(u0)]), which together with (4.11) gives min{1 + δ, f(v̄)}Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ∈ [Φ(u1),∞) ). Obviously, there exists σ > 0 such that min{1 + δ, f(v̄)} = 1 + σ, so (1 + σ)Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ≥ Φ(u1) ), which is equivalent to Φ((1 + σ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀ u ≥ u1), which ends the proof. � Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 333 Although the proof of the fact that the condition Δstr2 (0) can be extended to the interval [0, u2] (with arbitrary u2 > u0 such that (1+ε)u2 < b(Φ), u0 from the definition of the Δstr2 (0)-condition) is similar to the proof of Lemma 4.14, we will present a proof because we must use some simultaneous restrictions on ε and u2, namely, 0 < (1 + ε)u2 < b(Φ). Lemma 4.15. Assume that Φ is an Orlicz function such that Φ(b(Φ)) = ∞ whenever b(Φ) < ∞, Φ is strictly increasing on the interval [0, b(Φ)) and Φ ∈ Δstr2 (0). Then for any u2 ∈ (0, b(Φ)) and ε > 0 such that (1 + ε)u2 < b(Φ) there exists σ = σ (ε, u2) ∈ (0, ε) such that Φ((1 + σ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀ u ∈ [0, u2]). (4.12) Proof. Let u2, ε satisfy the assumptions of the lemma. Applying Definition 2.15 we find suitable δ = δ (ε) and u1 = u1 (ε) . If u2 ≤ u1, then we have nothing to prove. Let u2 > u1. By Definition 2.15 we get (1 + δ)Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ∈ [0,Φ(u1)]) (4.13) (see the proof of Lemma 4.14). The function f(v) = Φ−1((1 + ε)v) Φ−1(v) has values strictly greater than 1 and it is continuous on the inter- val [Φ(u1),Φ(u2)]. Therefore, there exists ṽ ∈ [Φ(u1),Φ(u2)] such that infv∈[Φ(u1),Φ(u2)] f(v) = f(ṽ). Consequently, f(ṽ)Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ∈ [Φ(u1),Φ(u2)]), which together with (4.13) yields min{1 + δ, f(ṽ)}Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ∈ [0,Φ(u2)]). If σ > 0 is such that min{1 + δ, f(ṽ)} = 1 + σ, we have (1 + σ)Φ−1(v) ≤ Φ−1((1 + ε)v) (∀ v ∈ [0,Φ(u2)]), which is equivalent to Φ((1 + σ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀ u ∈ [0, u2]) and the proof is finished. � Lemma 4.16. Assume that an Orlicz function Φ is strictly increasing and sat- isfies the suitable Δstr2 -condition. In the sequence case we assume additionally that Φ(b(Φ)) = ∞ whenever b(Φ) < ∞ and Φ is strictly increasing on the interval [0, b(Φ)). Then, for any sequence (xn)∞n=1 in L Φ(μ) (or, in �Φ resp.) such that ‖xn‖Φ ≤ c for any n ∈ N and ‖xn‖Φ → c as n → ∞, where c is a fixed positive number, we have IΦ ( xn c ) → c as n → ∞. 334 Y. Cui et al. AEM Proof. Let us start with the proof in the case when Ω = (0, 1) . Let c > 0. We have, by the assumptions of the Lemma, that c ≥ ‖xn‖Φ = IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) ≥ IΦ (xn c ) (∀n ∈ N). (4.14) Let ε > 0 and take u1 = u1(ε) > 0 such that Φ(2u1)μ(Ω) < ε. Define An = { t ∈ Ω : xn (t) c ≥ u1 } . By Lemma 4.14, using the condition Φ ∈ Δstr2 (∞), we know that there exists δ ∈ (0, 1) such that Φ((1 + δ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀u ≥ u1). (4.15) Since c‖xn‖Φ → 1 as n → ∞, there exists n0 ∈ N such that c ‖xn‖Φ ≤ 1 + δ for all n ≥ n0. Therefore, by Φ(2u1)μ(Ω) < ε and conditions (4.14) and (4.15), we get ‖xn‖Φ = IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) = IΦ ( c ‖xn‖Φ · xn c ) ≤ IΦ ( (1 + δ) xn c ) = IΦ ( (1 + δ) xn c χAn ) + IΦ ( (1 + δ) xn c χΩ\An ) ≤ (1 + ε)IΦ (xn c ) + Φ((1 + δ) u1)μ(Ω) ≤ (1 + ε)IΦ (xn c ) + ε ≤ IΦ (xn c ) + cε + ε. By the arbitrariness of ε > 0, this implies lim inf n→∞ IΦ (xn c ) ≥ lim inf n→∞ ‖xn‖Φ = lim n→∞ ‖xn‖Φ = c. On the other hand, if follows from inequalities (4.14) that lim sup n→∞ IΦ ( xn c ) ≤ c, so consequently, lim n→∞ IΦ ( xn c ) = c. In the case of Ω = (0,∞), the proof of the Lemma is almost the same, but easier because we have then inequality (4.15) for any u ≥ 0. Therefore, it is omitted. Now, we will present a proof for the sequence case. Since Φ satisfies the Δstr2 (0)-condition, it also satisfies the Δ2(0)-condition, whence IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) = ‖xn‖Φ ≤ c (see Lemma 2.18 and Theorem 2.14). Therefore, IΦ ( xn c ) ≤ c for any n ∈ N. Taking uc > 0 such that Φ(uc) = c, we obtain that xn(i)c ≤ uc < b(Φ) for any i, n ∈ N. Therefore, taking ε > 0 such that (1+ε)uc < b(Φ), by Lemma 4.15, there exists σ ∈ (0, ε) such that Φ((1 + σ)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u) (∀ u ∈ [0, uc]). (4.16) Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 335 Since c‖xn‖Φ ≤ 1 + σ for n large enough, we obtain ‖xn‖Φ = IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) = IΦ ( c ‖xn‖Φ · xn c ) (4.17) ≤ IΦ ( (1 + σ) xn c ) ≤ (1 + ε)IΦ (xn c ) ≤ IΦ (xn c ) + cε for n large enough. By the fact that ε > 0 satisfying the inequality (1+ε)uc < b(Φ) can be arbitrarily small, inequalities (4.17) imply that lim inf n→∞ IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) ≥ lim n→∞ ‖xn‖Φ. Since lim sup n→∞ IΦ ( xn c ) ≤ c [see inequalities (4.14)], we obtain lim n→∞ IΦ ( xn c ) = c. � In the further part of the paper we will need the following Lemma 4.17. Assume that Φ ∈ Δ2 (suitable for the measure space) and a(Φ) = 0. Then ‖xn‖Φ → 0 if and only if IΦ (xn) → 0. In [16, Lemma 6.4] it was proved that ‖xn‖Φ → 0 if and only if IΦ(λxn) → 0 as n → ∞ for any λ > 0. We can easily prove that if Φ ∈ Δ2 and a(Φ) = 0, then IΦ(xn) → 0 as n → ∞ implies that IΦ(λxn) → 0 for any λ > 0 as n → ∞. Theorem 4.18. Assume that Φ is a strictly increasing Orlicz function satisfy- ing the suitable Δstr2 -condition. In the sequence case, assume additionally that Φ(b(Φ)) = ∞ whenever b(Φ) < ∞ and that Φ is strictly increasing on the in- terval [0, b(Φ)). Then the Orlicz function (resp. sequence) space LΦ(μ) (resp. lΦ) is orthogonally uniformly monotone. Proof. Let c > 0 and assume that (An)∞n=1 ⊂ Σ, (xn)∞n=1 from LΦ(μ) are such that 0 ≤ xn ∈ LΦ(μ) and ‖xn‖Φ ≤ c for any n ∈ N and lim n→∞ ‖xnχAn‖Φ = c. Then, by Corollary 2.17 and Lemma 4.16, we get that lim n→∞ IΦ ( xn c ) = lim n→∞ IΦ (xnχAn c ) = c. Consequently, lim n→∞ IΦ (xnχΩ\An c ) = lim n→∞ [ IΦ (xn c ) − IΦ (xnχAn c )] = 0. Recall that Φ ∈ Δstr2 implies that Φ ∈ Δ2. By a(Φ) = 0, Φ ∈ Δ2 and Lemma 4.17, we obtain that ‖xn − xnχAn‖Φ = ‖xnχΩ\An‖Φ → 0 as n → ∞, which finishes the proof. In the sequence case the proof is similar. � Corollary 4.19. If a(Φ) = 0, then the Orlicz function space LΦ(μ) is orthogo- nally uniformly monotone in the following cases. (i) Φ is a convex function and Φ satisfies the suitable Δ2-condition. (i) Φ(u) = Ψ(us) for any u ∈ R+, where 0 < s ≤ 1, Ψ is a convex Orlicz function satisfying the suitable Δ2-condition. (iii) Φ is a concave and strictly increasing function on R+. 336 Y. Cui et al. AEM Proof. (i) It is well known (see [4, Theorem 1.13]) that if Φ is a convex Orlicz function satisfying the suitable Δ2-condition, then Φ satisfies the suitable Δstr2 - condition. (ii) The suitable Δ2-condition for Ψ means the suitable Δ2-condition for Φ. Since Ψ is convex, we have the suitable Δstr2 -condition for Ψ, so we also have the suitable Δstr2 -condition for Φ. (iii) If Φ is concave, then by Φ(0) = 0, we have for any fixed ε > 0 and any u ∈ R+ that Φ((1 + ε)u) ≤ (1 + ε)Φ(u), which means that Φ satisfies the Δstr2 -condition on the whole R+. Therefore, in any case among these three cases the thesis follows directly from Theorem 4.18. � Theorem 4.20. Assume that Φ is a convex Orlicz function and EΦ(μ) and LΦ(μ) are equipped with the Mazur–Orlicz F -norm. Then the following condi- tions are equivalent. (i) LΦ(μ) ∈ (UM). (ii) b (Φ) = ∞ and EΦ(μ) ∈ (UM). (iii) a(Φ) = 0 and Φ ∈ Δ2. (iv) LΦ(μ) ∈ (OUM). (v) LΦ(μ) ∈ (OLUM). (vi) LΦ(μ) ∈ (OSM). Proof. It is obvious that (i) implies (ii) (see Theorem 4.3). The fact that (ii) implies (iii) follows from the implication (v) ⇒ (iv) in Theorem 4.3. We will prove that (iii) implies (i). It is known that Φ ∈ Δ2 implies that Φ ∈ Δstr2 when Φ is convex (see [4, Theorem 1.13]). Let us take any c ∈ (0,∞) and any two sequences {xn}∞n=1, {yn}∞n=1 in LΦ(μ) such that 0 ≤ xn ≤ yn and ‖yn‖Φ ≤ c for any n ∈ N as well as lim n→∞ ‖xn‖Φ = lim n→∞ ‖yn‖Φ = c. Then, by Φ ∈ Δstr2 and by Lemma 4.16, we have lim n→∞ IΦ (xn c ) = lim n→∞ IΦ (yn c ) = c. By the convexity of Φ and by Φ(0) = 0, the function Φ is superadditive on R+, whence the modular IΦ is superadditive on (L0(μ))+, so also on (LΦ(μ))+. Therefore, 0 ≤ IΦ ( yn − xn c ) ≤ IΦ (yn c ) − IΦ (xn c ) → 0 as n → ∞, whence IΦ ( yn−xn c ) → 0 as n → ∞. By the assumption that a(Φ) = 0 and Φ ∈ Δ2, we obtain that ‖yn − xn‖Φ → 0. Clearly, (i) ⇒ (iv) ⇒ (v) ⇒ (vi) . Finally, (vi) ⇒ (iii) , by Corollary 4.8, which finishes the proof. � Theorem 4.21. Let Φ be a convex Orlicz function. Then the Orlicz sequence space lΦ equipped with the Mazur–Orlicz F -norm is uniformly monotone if and only if Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) and Φ(b(Φ)) = ∞ whenever b(Φ) < ∞. Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 337 Proof. The necessity follows from Corollary 4.12. The sufficiency can be done in a similar way as the proof of the implication (iii) ⇒ (i) from the previous theorem. � Now, we are going to study the Kadec–Klee properties in Orlicz spaces equipped with the Mazur–Orlicz F-norm. Recall that these properties have already been investigated in some Banach and quasi-Banach lattices by many authors (see for instance, [5,8,11,12,19,21,26–28]). It is known that properties Hl and the Kadec–Klee property with respect to μ−a.e. convergence (Hμ−a.e. for short) are the same properties for any σ−finite measure. Moreover, properties Hl and Hg are the same in the case of a non- atomic and finite measure. Consequently, we assume below that Ω = (0,∞), because the property Hg will be characterized later. Theorem 4.22. Assume that Ω = (0,∞) . The Orlicz function space LΦ(μ) has the Kadec–Klee property with respect to local convergence in measure (i.e. LΦ(μ) ∈ (Hl)) if and only if Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+). Proof. Sufficiency. Take any x ∈ LΦ(μ)\{0} and any sequence {xn}∞n=1 in LΦ(μ) such that ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ and xn → x locally in measure μ. By the assumption that Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+), we have that IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) = ‖x‖Φ and IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) = ‖xn‖Φ for any n ∈ N, which means that ‖x‖Φ = ∥ ∥ ∥Φ ◦ x‖x‖Φ ∥ ∥ ∥ L1 and ‖xn‖Φ = ∥ ∥ ∥Φ ◦ xn‖xn‖Φ ∥ ∥ ∥ L1 . Since ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ, we also have that xn‖xn‖Φ → x ‖x‖Φ locally in measure μ. Since μ is σ-finite, we get that there exists a strictly increasing sequence {nk}∞k=1 of natural numbers such that xnk ‖xnk ‖Φ → x‖x‖Φ μ- a.e.. By the continuity of Φ, we have that Φ ◦ xnk‖xnk ‖Φ → Φ ◦ x ‖x‖Φ μ-a.e.. Since the space L1(μ) has the Kadec–Klee property with respect to the μ-a.e. convergence, we obtain that ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥Φ ◦ xnk ‖xnk‖Φ − Φ ◦ x‖x‖Φ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ L1 → 0. In consequence, the sequence { |Φ ◦ xnk‖xnk ‖Φ − Φ ◦ x ‖x‖Φ | }∞ k=1 has a majorant y ∈ L1+(μ) (see [25]), whence we get Φ ◦ xnk‖xnk‖Φ − Φ ◦ x‖x‖Φ ≤ |Φ ◦ xnk‖xnk‖Φ − Φ ◦ x‖x‖Φ | ≤ y. 338 Y. Cui et al. AEM Applying the assumption that Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+), we conclude that Φ ◦ ( xnk ‖xnk‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) = Φ ◦ ( 1 2 2xnk ‖xnk‖Φ − 1 2 2x ‖x‖Φ ) ≤ Φ ◦ max ( 2|xnk | ‖xnk‖Φ , 2|x| ‖x‖Φ ) ≤ K { Φ ◦ max ( |xnk | ‖xnk‖Φ , |x| ‖x‖Φ )} ≤ K { Φ ◦ |xnk |‖xnk‖Φ + Φ ◦ |x|‖x‖Φ } ≤ K { Φ ◦ |x|‖x‖Φ + y } + KΦ ◦ |x|‖x‖Φ ∈ L1+(μ). Therefore, the sequence { Φ ◦ ( xnk ‖xnk ‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ )}∞ k=1 has a majorant in L1(μ) and it is convergent to zero μ-a.e.. By the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, IΦ ( xnk ‖xnk ‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) → 0 as k → ∞. Next, by Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+), we get that IΦ ( λ ( xnk ‖xnk ‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ )) → 0 for any λ > 0, that is, ∥ ∥ ∥ xnk ‖xnk ‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ∥ ∥ ∥ Φ → 0 as k → ∞. Since ‖xnk‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ, this yields that ‖xnk −x‖Φ → 0 as k → ∞. The necessity follows from Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 4.6. � Theorem 4.23. The Orlicz function space LΦ(μ) has the property Hg if and only if Φ ∈ Δ2. Proof. Necessity. Suppose Φ /∈ Δ2. Let Ω = (0, 1). If Φ /∈ Δ2 (∞) , then taking the sequence (xn)∞n=1 from the proof of Theorem 2.6 in [14], we have that m (suppxn) → 0. Set un = x − xn. Then un → x globally in measure and ‖x‖Φ = ‖un‖Φ = 1 = ‖x − un‖Φ for any n ∈ N. Thus LΦ(μ) /∈ (Hg) . Let Ω = (0,∞) . If Φ /∈ Δ2 (∞) , we follow as above. If Φ /∈ Δ2 (0) , then we can find the respective sequence (xn) ∞ n=1 such that xn → 0 uniformly (see the proof of Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 in [14]). The rest of the proof is the same. Sufficiency. Let Ω = (0, 1) . Take x, xn ∈ LΦ(μ), n = 1, 2, . . . such that ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ and xn → x globally in measure. Clearly, xn → x locally in measure, so, applying the proof of sufficiency of Theorem 4.22, we conclude that IΦ ( xnk ‖xnk‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) → 0 as k → ∞ (4.18) for some subsequence (xnk) ∞ k=1 of (xn) ∞ n=1 . Based on the double extract subse- quence theorem we may denote this subsequence (xnk) ∞ k=1 by (xn) ∞ n=1 . Recall that ‖zn − z‖Φ → 0 if and only if IΦ (λ (zn − z)) → 0 for each λ > 0 (see Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 339 Lemma 6.4 in [16]). Let λ > 1 and ε > 0. We will prove that IΦ ( λ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ )) < ε for sufficiently large n. Note that from the assumption that Φ ∈ Δ2 (∞) it follows that for each u1 > a (Φ) and every l > 1 there is a constant K = K (u1, l) > 1 such that Φ(lu) ≤ KΦ(u) for all u ≥ u1 (in the proof we apply only the continuity of Φ, see also [4]). Take K = K (u1, λ) , where u1 > a (Φ) satisfies the inequality Φ (u1) < ε/3. Denote An = { t ∈ Ω : λ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ xn (t) ‖xn‖Φ − x (t)‖x‖Φ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ > u1 } , A1n = { t ∈ An : ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ xn (t) ‖xn‖Φ − x (t)‖x‖Φ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ > u1 } , A2n = { t ∈ An : ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ xn (t) ‖xn‖Φ − x (t)‖x‖Φ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ u1 } . We have IΦ ( λ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ )) = IΦ ( λ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) χA1n ) +IΦ ( λ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) χA2n ) + IΦ ( λ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) χΩ/An ) ≤ K · IΦ (( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) χA1n ) + Φ(λu1) m ( A2n ) + ε/3. Since xn → x globally in measure, xn‖xn‖Φ → x ‖x‖Φ globally in measure, by Lemma 3.6 from [26], which works also with the same proof for symmetric F -spaces. In consequence, m ( A2n ) ≤ m (An) → 0 and, by (4.18), we get IΦ ( λ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ )) ≤ ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε for sufficiently large n. If Ω = (0,∞) , the proof is analogous and simpler, because the condition Φ ∈ Δ2 (∞) is replaced by Φ ∈ Δ2 (R+) . � Theorem 4.24. The Orlicz sequence space lΦ ∈ (Hc) if and only if Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) and Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞ when b (Φ) < ∞. Proof. The necessity follows from Proposition 3.5 and Corollary 4.10. Sufficiency. By Lemma 3.6 we may take x, xn ∈ ( lΦ ) + \ {0} , n = 1, 2, . . . , such that ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ and xn → x coordinatewise. Without loss of general- ity, we can also assume that ‖x‖Φ > 0. Since Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) , hΦ = lΦ. By Lemma 2.18, IΦ ( z ‖z‖Φ ) = ‖z‖Φ for each z ∈ lΦ. Then IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ ) → IΦ ( x ‖x‖Φ ) and 340 Y. Cui et al. AEM xn → x coordinatewise. Moreover, |xn|‖xn‖Φ → |x| ‖x‖Φ coordinatewise and con- sequently Φ ( |xn| ‖xn‖Φ ) → Φ ( |x| ‖x‖Φ ) coordinatewise, because Φ is continuous. Since l1 ∈ (Hc) , it follows that ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥Φ ( |xn| ‖xn‖Φ ) − Φ ( |x| ‖x‖Φ )∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ �1 → 0. Therefore, there is z ∈ l1 satisfying Φ ( |xn| ‖xn‖Φ ) − Φ ( |x| ‖x‖Φ ) ≤ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣Φ ( |xn| ‖xn‖Φ ) − Φ ( |x| ‖x‖Φ )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ z. Consequently, Φ (∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ) ≤ Φ ( max { |xn| ‖xn‖Φ , |x| ‖x‖Φ }) ≤ [ Φ ( |xn| ‖xn‖Φ ) + Φ ( |x| ‖x‖Φ )] ≤ [ z + Φ ( |x| ‖x‖Φ ) + Φ ( |x| ‖x‖Φ )] ∈ l1. Since Φ ( |xn| ‖xn‖Φ − |x|‖x‖Φ ) → 0 coordinatewise and l1 ∈ (OC) , it follows that IΦ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ) → 0. Applying the assumption that Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) and Lemma 4.17, we conclude that IΦ ( λ ( xn ‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ )) → 0 for any λ > 0, that is, ∥ ∥ ∥ xn‖xn‖Φ − x‖x‖Φ ∥ ∥ ∥ Φ → 0 (see Lemma 6.4 from [16]). Combining this together with the assumption ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ > 0, we get ‖xn − x‖Φ → 0 as desired. � Theorem 4.25. Suppose Φ is an Orlicz function such that Φ(b (Φ)) = ∞ when b (Φ) < ∞. The Orlicz sequence space lΦ has the property Hu if and only if a (Φ) > 0 or Φ ∈ Δ2 (0). Proof. Necessity. Suppose a (Φ) = 0 and Φ /∈ Δ2 (0) . Applying the proof of Theorem 2.5 in [14], we find a sequence (xn) ∞ n=1 in S ( lΦ ) + := S ( lΦ ) ∩ lΦ+ with pairwise disjoint supports such that xn → 0 uniformly and x := supxn ∈ S ( lΦ ) . Taking un = x−xn we have that ‖un‖Φ = ‖x‖Φ = 1 = ‖x − un‖Φ and un → x uniformly. It means that lΦ /∈ (Hu) . Sufficiency. Take x, xn ∈ lΦ, n = 1, 2, . . . such that ‖xn‖Φ → ‖x‖Φ and xn → x uniformly. If a (Φ) > 0 then for each λ > 0, we have that IΦ (λ (xn − x)) = 0 for sufficiently large n, which gives ‖xn − x‖Φ → 0. Sup- pose a (Φ) = 0 and Φ ∈ Δ2 (0) . Since Φ (b (Φ)) = ∞ when b (Φ) < ∞, by Theorem 4.24, we conclude that lΦ ∈ (Hc), which is even stronger than we need to have. � Vol. 93 (2019) Geometric properties of F-normed Orlicz spaces 341 Question Does the previous result remains true without the assumption Φ (b (Φ)) = ∞ when b (Φ) < ∞?
