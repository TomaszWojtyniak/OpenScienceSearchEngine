Abstract In recent years, the significance of industrial heritage has seemed to become a growing trend in the international heritage studies. Concerning their attributed values, and the crucial needs for urban development, this branch of cultural heritage has been considered the important grid of cities. This has caused a great acceptance of adaptive reuse practices especially among developing countries which is a smart response to an ongoing debate to reach sustainable development. The flexibility of these buildings and sites seems an important criterion, which can be improved through adaptive reuse practice. Therefore, this research aims to introduce the concept of flexibility in industrial heritage sites, evaluate its criteria among adaptive reuse practice, and make a comprehensive flexibility model for it. Indeed, the final goal is to determine the condition that based on the flexibility model, the adaptive reuse practice would be a proper way of encountering these sites. A historical-interpretation research method, analytical-description techniques, and questionnaire-based interviews are applied in this research. Results indicate that flexibility has genuinely been considered in this practice. Analysing flexibility techniques, this paper suggests a valuable framework to achieve the flexibility of industrial heritage as the presupposition of successful adaptive reuse in these sites. Keywords: Industrial heritage; Adaptive reuse; Flexibility; Iran Introduction The notion of industrial heritage nowadays has seemed to become a critically important branch of the multidisciplinary field of heritage studies in many parts of the world due to its significance since 1999 by official establishing of TICCIH (The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage). Concerning the importance of industrial heritage in terms of cultural, historical and technical values, they are considered highly significant structures. This is mainly why countries tend to preserve them as the important part of human culture [1-3], and more specifically remains of industrial culture [4]. They in turn, demonstrate humankind efforts to have a better life on the one hand, and a great deal of job opportunities they provided people with during industrial era on the other hand [5]. Consequently, adaptive reuse has become one of the accelerating trends in heritage studies as a profitable strategy [6], which tends to develop the potential of growth in these sites. This strategy could help communities, governments, and developers to reduce the environmental, social, economic [7], trustworthiness of culture [8], and even energy inefficiency problems [9, 10] at the cost of some * Corresponding author: Hassan.Bazazzadeh@Doctorate.PUT.Poznan.Pl http://www.ijcs.ro/ H. BAZAZZADEH et al. INT J CONSERV SCI 12, 1, 2021: 113-128 114 minor changes. Therefore, adaptive reuse is mainly an urban/regional planning strategy [11-13] rather than just an architectural reuse. Flexibility, one of the influential factors in the adaptive reuse process in many heritage scholars’ opinion, could support all the advantages of the cultural heritage reuse through fewer changes and low-budget projects. The flexible method of cultural heritage management potentially concerns about both historic characteristics of these sites through preservation and urban development simultaneously which could lead to sustainable management [14]. Despite the prevalence of this attitude for industrial heritage in Iran, it needs further and deeper studies. This research aims to discuss and clarify the concept of flexibility in industrial heritage management and describe flexibility criteria by which an adaptive reuse practice can potentially be improved. Moreover, by analyzing the research findings a comprehensive model of flexibility of the industrial heritage in Iran is made. According to this model, the conditions when adaptive reuse attitude is a proper way to treat can be recognized. Materials and Methods Questions and Goals In this research, we aim to response to the following questions: What is the main idea of flexibility for adaptive reuse practice of industrial heritage sites? What is the role of the flexibility in improvement of adaptive reuse practices? In addition, how the flexibility could be a measurable variable to choose the way of encountering industrial heritage sites? Research Method To reach the goals and answer the research questions the "historical interpretation", "analytical-description" techniques, as well as "historical studies" are applied in this research, which foster the evidence evaluation. "Fact findings", "fact assessment", "fact organization", and "fact analysis" are the major steps of this "historical interpretation". In addition, the existence of various judgments about a subject has been taken into account [15]. Moreover, the data collection of this paper draws on "in-situ observation" and questionnaire-based interviews. Amongst industrial heritage sites and buildings in Iran, the ones that adaptively reused are selected as the statistical population to assess flexibility. The questionnaire is filled by 30 professors in the field of architecture and heritage studies and professional accomplished Iranian architects for each case. Literature Review Flexiblity Since Walter Gropius, put the emphasis on the significance of "the flexibility" for "the modern lifestyle" in 1954 [16], this term has become one of the most appealing one in the field of architecture. Both terms "Flexibility" and "adaptability" are used interchangeably and considered by some authors [17, 18] to have overlapping meaning. Nevertheless, some researchers have been separated these concepts. For instance, Bernardes and Hanna believe that term “flexibility” has been used indiscriminately with “agility” and “responsiveness” [19]. On the other hand, Groak conceives that flexibility means the capability of different physical arrangements during extensions or some other changes, while adaptability is the capability of different social uses, which in turn, means the opportunity to use a same space for various functions [20, 21]. However, in the field of architecture the term flexibility seems to be more popular than other terms. Figure 1 illustrates a graph showing how these terms have appeared in books (written in English) over the previous years. It clearly proves that the usage of the "Flexible Architecture" term has been always more widespread. IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBILITY IN ADAPTIVE REUSE OF INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE: IRANIAN CASES http://www.ijcs.uaic.ro 115 Despite ongoing arguments, authors in various fields tend to focus on this concept from their specific area of expertise. Therefore, taking all these opinions into account, a comprehensive definition of flexibility seems feasible. Fig. 1. The usage of the terms "Sustainable Architecture", "Flexible Architecture" and "Adaptable Architecture" over time [22] Table 1.

Computer Science X X X [36] Table 1 indicates that the usage of "flexibility" not only can be found in the literature of architecture but also in different research fields. While "Measure" column is for researchers who believe the flexibility is measurement tool for some potentials of new or existing architectural construction, "Design" means the flexibility interferes directly with the design of a system. "Performance" is marked when the existence of a tangible link between flexibility and system performance is suggested and "Cost" refers to authors who assume the flexibility is linked to the costs and saving money. For almost all researchers, flexibility has been seen an intrinsic feature of the system, except Zelonovic and Ross who believe flexibility is a transition and a measurement tool to evaluate the capacity of a system to adapt respectively. Consequently, the meaning and usage of flexibility is limited to a specific scientific area and it has a wide range of meaning. Therefore, a deep dive is needed to the definition of flexibility in the specific area that directly related to the topic of this research. Flexible Architecture One of the main reasons that convinces architects to (re)think about the flexibility is the unsustainability of traditional construction as it causes expenditure of resources [37, 38]. H. BAZAZZADEH et al. INT J CONSERV SCI 12, 1, 2021: 113-128 116 Indeed, this attitude in construction industry can lead to promote the global sustainability by reducing construction costs and also resource depletion [39]. Various definitions of flexibility in architecture are heavily criticized for ambiguity and their vague language. Hence, to reach a comprehensive definition of flexible architecture and to determine the accurate criteria, a deep overview of this idea from various points of view is crucial. Table 2 illustrates different indicators of flexibility in architecture according to different authors. Table 2. Criteria and indicators of flexibility in architecture based on Estaji's work [33] Criteria Indicators Definition Reference A d a p ta b il iy Expandability Ability to Add to the quantity of space [40] Upgradability Ability to accommodate potential performance requirements Extendibility Possibility of adapting to additional user demands [41] Partition-ability Ability to split up, rearrange or combine spatial units Multi-functionality Possibility of using or deploying for several functions Expansion Ability to extent the use of the surface [42] Transferability Ability to Change of location Redesign-ability Ability to changing the layout of the user units Connect-ability Ability of adjacent spaces to be connected through sliding dividers [17, 43] Divisibility Ability to divide a larger unit Neutral-functionality Having spaces without specific use Convertibility Ability to allow changes in usage/function [44] Rearrangeability Ability to change the layout of spaces [45] Refittability Ability to change the performance Combinability Ability to generate combinations of basic components [46] Polyvalency Ability to be used in different ways without adjustment [47] Transformability Ability to change of shape and arrangement of spaces [33] Scalability Ability to change the size Visitability Possibility that allow people with disabilities to use complex [48] D is m a n tl in g a n d m a te ri a l re u se Lifetime Compatibility Lack of strong interconnect short lifetime components with those having longer life times [40] Responsive Being Smart, Intelligent, Automated [33] Recyclability The ability of reuse (space, component and material) Disaggregatability Capability of material to be reusable or reprocess-able [44] Dismantlability Capability of being demolished safely, efficiently and quickly Demount-ability Ability to reconfigure/ dismantle [49] In st a ll a ti o n a n d d is a ss e m b ly Parallel Disassembly Capability to disassemble components simultaneously not sequential [40, 50] Logistical deconstruction Capability to handling and locating components logistical after disassembly and storage them [51] Optimize components Using a low number of components and larger ones [52] Simple technology Using as simple technology and tools as possible light components Using lighter components [53] Durability Selecting materials, assemblies and systems that require less maintenance, repair and replacement Taking all these above indicators into account, an extensive definition of flexibility seems to be clear. Indeed, flexibility is a mixture of these indicators and consequently, a building can be called flexible, only if it can accommodate changes and lowering material, transport, energy consumption and waste and pollution [54]. Therefore, such structure can lead to economic, environment and social sustainability [55] by providing these indicators. Similar in their essence, indicators of flexibility can be categorized into four criteria which already have been introduced by Sadafi and her colleagues [32]. Each criterion can in turn, enhance the flexibility and the general evaluation of these criteria can indicate the rate of flexibility of a building: • Adaptability • Dismantling and material reuse • Installation and disassembly • Durability IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBILITY IN ADAPTIVE REUSE OF INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE: IRANIAN CASES http://www.ijcs.uaic.ro 117 By respecting to their efforts to find effective strategies for increasing flexibility of buildings for each criterion, admittedly, durability has not been adequately examined in their works. While evaluating flexibility in general may distinguish durability from other criteria, according to the focus of this paper, which is built environment (a specific branch of cultural heritage), this criterion plays an essential role in the evaluation process. To reach and even increase or in this case evaluate the flexibility of a building numerous researchers have tried to offer specific strategies to reach the flexibility. Tables 3, 4, and 5 show strategies for each criterion by which in design process the flexibility can be improved and they can be used for evaluating flexibility in built environments according to various authors.

Despite this historic background, much of the true inspiration came from adaptive reuse practices documented in Sherban Cantacuzino’s works [68, 69] which indicates valuable examples of adaptive reuse. Indeed, adaptive reuse method encourages people, experts and all involved communities to think out of the box before jumping to the conclusion on what we should do with these useless buildings or infrastructures. Many experts defined the potential of this practice during the 1980s [14, 70, 71]. As Brebbia has defined, through three distinguishable perspectives, adaptive reuse could be analysed which are typological, technical, and strategic approaches [72]. In this research, we focus on the third approach: strategic approach. This approach mainly discusses the process and strategies applied for converting significant buildings. These reuses take place through various changes in different layer of the building, which adapt the building with new purposes [73]. Undoubtedly, devoting enough time, energy and money for these changes is inevitable. However, these items could be economised through lower construction and acquisition cost [74] if the building has the capacity to accommodate changes over a long time. These changes can be happened in different layers of building system and according to Brand (1995) these layers can be categorized into six layers: site, skin, structure, service, space plan and stuff [75]. Although the pace and the type of changes tend to be differed from one layer to another, the general change is the aggregate of slight changes in each layer. General changes in the building can be divided into 3 different changes through adaptive reuse practice based on Slaughter (2001) point of view: changes in function, capacity and flow [58]. The assessment of changes in each type can be conducted based on three types of transformations: "spatial", "structural", and "elements and material [66] and each transformation needs specific requirements. Indeed, the building should respond and provide requirements for each transformation and in this way, it can accommodate changes. Figure 2 shows requirements of each type of change based on transformation, it should be mentioned that durability is necessary for each change and therefore it does not appear in this figure. IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBILITY IN ADAPTIVE REUSE OF INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE: IRANIAN CASES http://www.ijcs.uaic.ro 119 Fig. 2. different possible changes of a building through adaptive reuse process, their transformations and requirements based on Sadafi and her colleagues' work [28] Industrial Heritage Industrial heritage was initially mentioned in England during the 20th century has been the matter of debates amongst expert. It includes remained examples of industrial culture which enjoys historic, technological, architectural and scientific values [2, 76]. Possessing countless values in various perspectives, industrial heritage sites should be conserved as an intangible heritage alongside local people as an integrated system [77]. While, these buildings and structures describe the history of architectural and technological development and a symbol for social-cultural values of their time [78], they are now threatened by immediate destruction. Utilizing these sites as future-oriented economic resources with strong potential for the generating a new identity which connects future to the past [79] has turned into a popular trend among governments [80]. Conservation of heritage sites through adaptive reuse practice can improve the physical conditions of the environment and preserve their unique values as well [81-85]. The crucial question is that "Should all industrial heritage sites be protected through this method?" We discuss that only the ones with proper conditions in terms of flexibility should be protected through adaptive reuse practice and other sites that do not have this condition should be treated in some other ways. To reach a certainty in testing this hypothesis we analysed adaptive reuse practice of industrial heritage sites in Iran as case study. Industrial Heritage of Iran The term industry in Iran before the industrial revolution had referred to limited activities in small workshops namely; carpet, cloth weaving, poetry, and structures for using energies like windmills and water mills. While during the 19th century, some vast changes took place just in Europe, but over time, the impact of these changes extended beyond boundaries of Europe and many different parts of the world experienced “the Industrial Revolution” and its consequences in different ways [84]. Started at Qajar dynasty (1795-1925) because of urgent need for military technology and the establishment of modern schools in Iran, the process of industrialization in Iran significantly developed, and transport infrastructures, more than 270 factories, government buildings, and national railroad were among the most critical ones. This phenomenon caused the formation of a new civil society and created notable changes in the method and process of human life of this era through industrial structures and buildings [86]. Therefore, almost all industrial sites and buildings of Qajar and Pahlavi era as signs of the dominant industrial culture and the evidence of industrialization process in Iran are known as industrial heritage of Iran. According to a very accurate survey, which has been conducted in Iran by TICCIH in recent years, more than 350 industrial heritage have been identified and more than 250 sites and H. BAZAZZADEH et al. INT J CONSERV SCI 12, 1, 2021: 113-128 120 buildings have been accurately investigated that the summary of this research can be found in Samadzadehyazdi and her colleagues' work [7].

Adaptive reuse practice as a smart H. BAZAZZADEH et al. INT J CONSERV SCI 12, 1, 2021: 113-128 122 way of treating these sites can protect industrial heritage's cultural values as well as decrease construction costs and wastes, which can lead to contribution to energy efficiency that is crucial to today's environmental issues. Consequently, the flexibility of this practice as an influential factor according to hypothesis of this research is analysed. In order to reach that a questionnaire-based interview based on criteria of flexibility, which had been extracted before, was made. Filled by 30 professors in Architecture and cultural heritage discipline and professional accomplished Iranian architects, this questionnaire seeks to evaluate flexibility through each criterion and their strategy. The results of questionnaire (Fig. 4) confirms that the rates of flexibility for all cases are more than 50% and the average of this variable for all cases is 55%. It means that all adaptive reuse practices of industrial heritage have a proper situation in terms of flexibility and even the lowest mean score of each criterion is more than 50% and it shows the strength each criteria of flexibility in case studies. "Durability", "Adaptability", "Dismantling and material reuse" and "Installation and disassembly" can gain highest to lowest mean score among cases respectively. Having the highest score among aspects of flexibility, "Durability" can be regarded as the most significant criteria by which the flexibility could change. It is followed by "Adaptability" which is directly related to spatial features that enable structure to accommodate changes. Fig. 4. Scores of the indicators of flexibility for each case By analysis of the responses, a result clearly shows that the "Durability" in terms of material, components and technology is drastically crucial to flexibility. On the other hand, "Adaptability" that has the most relationship with architectural spaces and design is ranked as the second significant critical factor to determine flexibility in adaptive reuse practice of industrial heritage of Iran. While, other aspect of flexibility, "Dismantling and material reuse" and "Installation and disassembly", mainly related to technical aspect of building or site gain the lowest mean score, yet their score is above 50% and more than average. IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBILITY IN ADAPTIVE REUSE OF INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE: IRANIAN CASES http://www.ijcs.uaic.ro 123 Conclusions Containing countless various values (such as cultural, technical, etc.), industrial heritage has been assumed as a new kind of cultural heritage that can play a significant role in the development of each society. Recognizing these sites can lead to the enhancement of productive spirit of society, as they are the evidence of humankind efforts for better life through different industries. These values alongside with features like having large scale and locating in proper urban grids make these sites very special. On the one hand, they are in danger of disappearing just because of economic profitability. On the other hand, they have a great potential to be revitalised as a cultural and profitable place through thoughtful ways of treating them. Adaptive reuse practice as one of the popular strategies for encountering industrial heritage sites tends to protect intangible values of this heritage through some monuments, which refers to industrial spirit of original industrial function, as well as enhance urban development by proposing to add values to these sites by applying a new function. This specific type of reuse can save their outstanding values and can add economic profitability to these sites, which corresponds to data from the literature [88-93]. Flexibility as one of most important features of each structure plays a major role in this attitude towards industrial heritage. This variable can accurately define that how much an industrial heritage building or site has the potential to be reused. This feature includes four criteria including; "Adaptability", "Dismantling and material reuse", "Installation and disassembly", and "Durability". Consequently, by analysing these criteria and the strategy to reach to each one, the flexibility of each industrial heritage site can be analysed. The findings confirm that in all adaptive reuse projects of industrial heritage in Iran flexibility receives a very high score. In other words, adaptive reuse practices have been taken place in a case with high rate of flexibility. This can be interpreted as a statement that industrial heritage sites with low scores of flexibilities might be unable to accommodate possible future changes easily. On the other hand, four aspects of flexibility refer to specific features of a building or site and together they make a comprehensive model of flexibility in adaptive reuse practice in industrial heritage. Through analysing these criteria in case studies, a comprehensive model of flexibility for adaptive reuse practice of industrial heritage sites is obtained (Fig. 5). This model can show the importance of each criterion in the flexibility of industrial heritage sites. Hence, by interpreting this model it is easily understandable that durability of these sites has the most influential impact on their flexibility. Fig. 5. The model of flexibility in industrial heritage of Iran H. BAZAZZADEH et al. INT J CONSERV SCI 12, 1, 2021: 113-128 124 Taking all these analyses into account, the main suggestion of this paper is to point out that, in future projects for treating industrial heritage sites or buildings, the analysis of flexibility will be necessary to conduct before starting to plan any strategy for these architectural constructions. Consequently, adaptive reuse practice could be a proper way of encountering sites with satisfying flexibility rate and for sites with low-rate of flexibility other attitude should be applied based on their special conditions.
