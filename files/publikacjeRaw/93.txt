In this article we describe the implementation of an online-coupled gas-phase chemistry model in the turbulence resolving PALM model system 6.0. The new chemistry model is part of the PALM-4U components (read: PALM for you; PALM for urban applications) which are designed for application of PALM model in the urban environment (Maronga et al., 2020). The latest version of the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP, 2.2.3), has been utilised for the numerical integration of gas-phase chemical5 reactions. A number of tropospheric gas-phase chemistry mechanisms of different complexity have been implemented ranging from the photostationary state to more complex mechanisms such as CBM4, which includes major pollutants namely O3, NO, NO2, CO, a simplified VOC chemistry and a small number of products. Further mechanisms can also be easily added by the user. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the chemistry model, its structure along with its various features, input requirements, its application and limitations. A case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the new chemistry10 model in the urban environment. The computation domain of the case study is comprised of part of Berlin, Germany, covering an area of 6.71 x 6.71 km with a horizontal resolution of 10 m. We used "PARAMETERIZED" emission mode of the chemistry model that only considers emissions from traffic sources. Three chemical mechanisms of varying complexity and one no- reaction (passive) case have been applied and results are compared with observations from two permanent air quality stations in Berlin that fall within the computation domain. The results show importance of online photochemistry and dispersion of air15 pollutants in the urban boundary layer. The simulated NOx and O3 species show reasonable agreement with observations. The agreement is better during midday and poorest during the evening transition hours and at night. CBM4 and SMOG mechanisms show better agreement with observations than the steady state PHSTAT mechanism. 1 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

The high population density in urban areas leads to intense resource utilisation, increased energy5 consumption and high traffic volumes which results in large amount of air pollutant emissions. Various urban features such as heterogeneity of building distribution, large amount of impervious material, scarcity of vegetation, and street geometry can influence the atmospheric flow, its turbulence regime, and the micro-climate within the urban boundary layer that accordingly modify the transport, chemical transformation, and removal of air pollutants. (Hidalgo et al., 2008). Air pollution has multitude of complex effects on human health, material, ecology and environment. In order to develop policies and strategies to protect10 human health and environment, a better understanding of the interaction between air pollutants and the complex flow within the urban built areas is necessary. Air quality of a given region is strongly dependent on the meteorological conditions and pollutant emissions (Seaman, 2000; Jacob and Winner, 2009). In urban canopies turbulence can modify pollutant concentrations both within and downstream of urban areas. Interactions between meteorology and chemistry are complex and mostly non-linear. Numerical models are useful15 tools to capture these interactions and help to understand the effect of meteorology on the chemical processes. Modelling of air quality on the regional scale has made major advances within the past decades (Baklanov et al., 2014). However, small scale dispersion of pollutants from traffic and other sources within urban areas and their chemical and physical transformation is still poorly understood and difficult to predict due to uncertainty in emissions and complexity of modelling turbulence within and above the urban canopies. Besides, the computational costs for including air pollution chemistry and physics into the models20 are remarkably high due to additional prognostic equations for chemical species and the corresponding chemical reactions. Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based dispersion models are now widely used for assessing urban air quality by providing predictions of present and future air pollution levels as well as temporal and spatial variations (Vardoulakis et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2017). In these models atmospheric turbulence at the city level is primarily resolved by Reynolds-Averaged Eddy-viscosity and turbulent kinetic-energy-dissipation (k-ε) where turbulence is fully parameterized and thus cannot provide25 information about turbulence structures and its consequent effects on the atmospheric chemistry (Meroney et al., 1995, 1996; Li et al., 2008). Some of these RANS models are able to resolve buildings and trees e.g. MITRAS (Salim et al., 2018) and ASMUS (Gross, 2012), however, in general RANS models due to their inherent weakness of parameterizing flow, are less accurate (Xie and Castro, 2006; Blocken, 2018; Maronga et al., 2019). Chang and Meroney (2003) argues that dispersion of gaseous species is essentially unsteady and cannot be predicted by steady-state approach. To explicitly resolve unsteadiness30 and intermittency in the turbulent flow we need turbulence resolving simulations. In contrast to RANS, Large eddy simulation (LES) models are able to resolve turbulence and provide detailed information on the relevant flow variables (Baker et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008; Maronga et al., 2015, 2020). A large number of turbulence- 2 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. resolving LES models are being used from boundary layer to street canyon scales to model urban climate. e.g. Henn and Sykes (1992); Walton et al. (2002); Walton and Cheng (2002); Chang and Meroney (2003); Baker et al. (2004); Chung and Liu (2012); Nakayama et al. (2014). Many large eddy simulations studies that include transport of reactive scalars have been conducted e.g.,Baker et al. (2004), modelled the NO-NO2-O3 chemistry and dispersion in an idealised street canyon and Vila-Guerau de Arellano et al. (2006) investigated the influence of shallow cumulus clouds on the pollutant transport and transformation by5 means of LES. With the increasing computational power, more chemical reactants and mechanisms have been added into LES codes, for example the formation of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) aerosol including dry deposition (Barbaro et al., 2015) and photostationary equilibrium (Grylls et al., 2019). Furthermore, Vilà-Guerau De Arellano and Duynkerke (1997); Vilà-Guerau de Arellano et al. (2004a, b); Górska et al. (2006); Ouwersloot et al. (2011); Lenschow et al. (2016); Li et al. (2016); Lo and Ngan (2017) investigated the vertical turbulent transport of trace gases in the convective planetary boundary layer. Most of the10 LES-based pollutant dispersion studies investigated the flow and ventilation characteristics in street canyons (Liu et al., 2002; Walton et al., 2002; Walton and Cheng, 2002; Baker et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008; Moonen et al., 2013; Keck et al., 2014; Toja-Silva et al., 2017) or other idealised structures. These studies indicated that LES coupled air pollution models can help to explain micro-scale urban features and observed pollutant transport characteristics in cities (Han et al., 2019). However, most of these LES models either do not contain detailed atmospheric composition or full range of urban climate15 features such as human biometeorology, indoor climate, thermal stress, a detailed air chemistry or these are difficult to adapt to the state-of-the-art parallel computer systems due to lack of scalability on clustered computer systems which restrict their applicability on to large domains (Maronga et al., 2015, 2019). This paper describes the chemistry model that has been implemented in the PALM model system 6.0 as part of PALM-4U (PALM for urban applications) components. In the past PALM has been used to study urban turbulence structures (Letzel20 et al., 2008). Some studies also investigated dispersion of reactive pollutants (NO,NO2 and O3) using simple steady-state chemistry in PALM in the urban street canyons (Cheng and Liu, 2011; Park et al., 2012; Han et al., 2018, 2019). The PALM- 4U components are essentially designed for application in urban environment and offers several features required to simulate urban environment such as an energy balance solver for urban and natural surfaces, radiative transfer in the urban canopy layer, biometeorological analysis products, self-nesting to allow very high resolution in regions of special interest, atmospheric25 aerosols and gas-phase chemistry (Raasch and Schröter, 2001; Maronga et al., 2015, 2020). In order to offer the latter feature, an ’online’ coupled chemistry model has been newly implemented into PALM, which is presented in this paper. The chemistry model includes chemical transformations in the gas phase, a simple photolysis pa- rameterization, dry deposition processes and an emission module to read anthropogenic pollutant emissions. The gas-phase chemistry has been implemented using the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) (Damian et al., 2002) allowing automatic generation of30 the corresponding model code in order to obtain the necessary flexibility in the choice of chemical mechanisms. Due to the very high computational demands of an LES-based urban climate model, this flexibility with respect to the degree of detail of the gas-phase chemistry mechanism is of critical importance. A number of ready-to-use chemical mechanisms with varying com- plexity and detail are supplied with PALM. Furthermore, the gas-phase chemistry is coupled to the aerosol module SALSA 3 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. implemented in PALM (Kurppa et al., 2019) which includes a detailed description of the aerosol number size distribution, chemical composition and aerosol dynamic processes. The analysis provided in this work is mostly qualitative and intended to show first applications of the chemistry model in a real urban environment, thereby demonstrating its capabilities and its flexibility. A detailed description of this novel chemistry model and its implementation to PALM is provided in section 2. The model application and details of the numerical setup for a5 case study representing a selected area in central Berlin, Germany, are described in section 3, whereas results of the application of the chemistry model and comparison of simulation results with observations are provided in section 4. In the end, concluding remarks are provided in section 5. 2 Model Description 2.1 PALM and PALM-4U10 The PALM model system 6.0, consists of the PALM core and PALM-4U (PALM for urban applications) components (Maronga et al., 2020) implemented to PALM under the MOSAIK (Model-based city planning and application in climate change) project (Maronga et al., 2019), one of which is the chemistry module described in this paper. The core of the PALM model version 6.0 (Maronga et al., 2020) solves the non-hydrostatic, filtered, incompressible Navier- Stokes equations in Boussinesq-approximated form for the three wind components (u, v, w) and scalar variables on a Cartesian15 grid. The scalar variables comprise potential temperature (θ), water vapour mixing ratio (qv), optional cloud and rain water, one passive scalar and either the subgrid-scale turbulent kinetic energy (SGS-TKE) in LES mode (Maronga et al., 2020). By default these SGS terms are parameterized using a 1.5-order closure after (Deardorff, 1980). The model uses a fifth- order advection scheme of Wicker and Skamarock (2002) and a third order Runge-Kutta scheme for time steping. Monin- Obukhov similarity is assumed between every individual surface element and the first computational grid level. For details on20 meteorological and urban climate features and available parameter options, see Resler et al. (2017), and Maronga et al. (2020). Additionally, PALM-4U includes options of fully interactive surface and radiation schemes, and a turbulence closure based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) mode. The implementation of atmospheric chemistry is described in the following sections. 2.2 The chemistry model25 Atmospheric chemistry is integrated into the PALM code as a separate module (Fig. 1) that utilises the meteorological fields of PALM as input. Chemistry is coupled ’online’ with PALM-4U, i.e., the prognostic equations for the chemistry compounds are solved consistently with the equations for momentum, heat, and water constituents. This implementation of chemistry allows for a consideration of the impact of trace gases and aerosol particles on meteorology by radiative effects and aerosol cloud interactions.30 4 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

Schematic of PALM-4U chemistry model Depending on the need, a user can select a chemistry mechanisms of different complexity. The Fortran code for the selected gas-phase chemistry mechanism is generated by a preprocessor based on KPP (Damian et al., 2002). The latter is described in more detail in Section 2.2.2. Besides chemical transformations in the gas phase and a simple photolysis parameterization (Section 2.2.3) the chemistry module includes dry deposition (Section 2.2.5), an interface to the aerosol module SALSA (Kurppa et al., 2019) (Section 2.2.4) and an option for anthropogenic emissions (Section 2.3).5 5 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. 2.2.1 Prognostic equations When gas phase chemistry is invoked, N additional prognostic equations are solved, with N being the number of variable compounds of the chemical reaction scheme. Except for the SGS flux terms, the overbar indicating filtered quantities is omitted to improve readability. The three-dimensional prognostic equation for an atmospheric pollutant then read as: ∂ cn ∂ t =−1 ρ ∂ ρuj cn ∂ xj − 1 ρ ∂ ρu ′′ j c ′′ n ∂ xj + ( ∂ cn ∂ t ) chem + Ψn , with i, j ∈ (1,2,3) , (1)5 where cn (n= 1,N ) is the concentration of the respective air constituent, which can be either a reactive or passive gas-phase species or an aerosol particulate matter compound. The term on the left-hand side is the total time derivative of the pollutant concentration. The first two terms on the right-hand side represent the explicitly resolved and the SGS transport of the scalar chemical quantity in x, y and z direction. A double prime indicates a SGS variable. The third term represents the change in concentration (cn) of the trace gas n over time due to production and loss to chemical reactions, which can be described as10 follows: ( ∂ cn ∂t ) chem = φn(cm 6=n) +ϕn(cm 6=n) · cn , (2) where φn and ϕn indicate the production and loss, respectively, of species n. For most of these production and loss reactions the rates are dependent on temperature and pressure. The last term in Eq. 1 (Ψn) stands for sources (i.e., emissions) and sinks (i.e. deposition, scavenging). The number of prognostic equations depends on the number of species included in the chemical15 mechanism and it is determined automatically during the KPP preprocessing step (Section 2.2.2). 2.2.2 Gas phase chemistry implementation The Fortran subroutines for solving the chemical reactions of a given gas phase chemistry mechanism are generated automat- ically with the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP), version 2.2.3 (Damian et al., 2002; Sandu et al., 2003; Sandu and Sander, 2006). KPP creates the code from a list of chemical reactions that represent a certain chemical mechanism. Within the PALM envi-20 ronment, the subroutines with the integrator for the desired gas-phase chemistry mechanism are generated by a preprocessor named kpp4palm, which is based on the KP4 preprocessor (Jöckel et al., 2010). As a first step, kpp4palm starts the KPP pre- processor. As a second step, the code from KPP is transformed to a PALM subroutine. As described by Jöckel et al. (2010), the preprocessing includes also an optimisation of the LU (lower–upper) decomposition of the sparse Jacobian of the ordinary differential equation system for the chemistry rate equations.25 KPP offers a variety of numerical solvers for the system of coupled ordinary differential equations describing the chemical reactions. Tests comparing the performance of the Rosenbrock solvers implemented in KPP have shown that the use of the most simple Rosenbrock solver, Ros-2, did not lead to significantly different results than the use of the Rosenbrock solvers 6 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

Therefore, the Ros-2 solver was chosen as the default solver for the PALM-4U chemistry model. The automatic code generation by kpp4palm and KPP allows for high flexibility in the choice of gas phase chemical mech- anisms and numerical solvers. Since the number of variable compounds of a mechanism from KPP is used to determine the number of prognostic equations (Eq. 1), it is also possible to add prognostic equations for an arbitrary number of passive tracers5 by simply including reactions of the form A→A in the list of chemical reactions which serves as input for KPP. For example the passive tracer mechanism "passive" contains the following equations in the passive.eqn file: { 1.} PM10 = PM10 : 1.0 ; { 2.} PM25 = PM25 : 1.0 ; (see Sect. S2..S9 of the Supplement for all .eqn files).10 The chemistry model includes a number of ready-to-use chemical mechanisms summarised in Table 1. The first two mech- anisms describe only one or two passive tracers which represent PM10 and PM2.5 (particulate matter with the aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm and ≤ 2.5 µm, respectively) without any chemical transformations. The large number of species preclude the use of the well-known and widely used full Carbon-Bond-IV (CBM4) (Gery et al., 1989) mechanism for practical appli-15 cations over larger domains, we, therefore, also included computationally less demanding mechanisms, such as SMOG and its simplified version ’SIMPLE’. By and large the photostationary equilibrium (mechanism PHSTAT) represents the most simple mechanism including comprising of only three species and two reactions. The latter two mechanisms are also supplied with an additional passive tracer which can be used to represent PM10 (mechanisms PHSTATP and SIMPLEP). Three more mech- anisms which can be used in combination with the sectional aerosol module SALSA (Kurppa et al., 2019) are described in20 Section 2.2.4. Two of the currently available mechanisms, SMOG and SIMPLE, include only major pollutants such as ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), a highly simplified chemistry of volatile organic compounds 7 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. (VOCs) and a very small number of products. For the convenience of the users, it is not required to run kpp4palm for the ready-to-use mechanisms (Table 1) as their Fortran subroutines are already supplied with PALM. Currently PHSTATP is the default mechanism which will automatically be compiled with the rest of the PALM source code when the chemistry option is switched on. However, users can also add modified versions of the existing chemical mechanisms or define completely new mechanisms according to their specific needs.5 2.2.3 Photolysis frequencies The parameterization of the photolysis frequencies is adopted from the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) v3 according to Saunders et al. (2003). Photolysis frequencies are described as a function of the solar zenith angle ϑ and three parameters, which are specific for each photolysis reaction: J = l (cosϑ)m exp(−nsecϑ) . (3)10 Values for l, m and n are given for the relevant photolysis reactions in Saunders et al. (2003) and on the MCM web page (http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/parameters/photolysis_param.htt). Currently only a simple parameterized photolysis scheme is available for photochemical reactions. More extensive photolysis schemes such as Fast-J based on radiative transfer modelling will be included in the future. These models will also make use of the shading due to buildings, which is already implemented for the shortwave radiation in the PALM-4U urban surface model.15 2.2.4 Coupling to SALSA aerosol module The sectional aerosol module SALSA2.0 (Kokkola et al., 2008) has recently been implemented into PALM and a detailed description is given in Kurppa et al. (2019). SALSA describes the aerosol number size distribution, aerosol chemical compo- sition and aerosol dynamic processes. Currently the full SALSA implementation in PALM includes the following chemical compounds in the particulate phase: sulphuric acid (H2SO4), organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), nitric acid (HNO3),20 ammonium (NH3), sea salt, dust and water (H2O). Aerosol particles can grow by condensation and dissolution to liquid wa- ter of gaseous sulphuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3) and semi- and non-volatile organics (SVOC and NVOC), which establishes a link between SALSA and the chemistry module. SALSA is coupled to the gas-phase chemistry when the gas-phase compounds listed above (H2SO4, HNO3, NH3, SVOC and NVOC) are either included in the gas phase chemistry scheme or are derived from prognostic variables of the gas phase25 chemistry. Currently, PALM-4U includes three different mechanisms in which SALSA is coupled with the chemistry model. In the mechanisms ’SALSAGAS’ and ’SALSA+PHSTAT’, H2SO4, HNO3, NH3, SVOC and NVOC are treated as passive com- pounds and are only transported within the gas-phase chemistry model, whereas in ’SALSA+SIMPLE’, HNO3 is formed by the reaction NO2 + OH→ HNO3. Additionally, any of the other mechanisms given in Table 1 or any user-supplied mechanism can also be coupled to SALSA.30 8 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. 2.2.5 Deposition Deposition is a major sink of atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Currently, only dry deposition processes are included as precipitation (leading to wet deposition of pollutants) is not yet included in PALM. For dry deposition, a resistance approach is taken where the exchange flux is the result of a concentration difference between atmosphere and earth surface and the resistance between them. Several pathways exist for this flux, each with its own resistance and concentration. The aerodynamic5 resistance depends mainly on the atmospheric stability. In PALM, it is calculated via Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, based on roughness lengths for heat and momentum and the assumption of a constant flux layer between the surface and the first grid level. For gases, the quasi-laminar layer resistance depends on the atmospheric conditions and diffusivity of the deposited gas and it is calculated following (Simpson et al., 2003). Finally, the surface (canopy) resistance for gases, which is the most10 challenging resistance to estimate due to the enormous diversity of surfaces, is calculated using the DEPAC module (Van Zanten et al., 2010). DEPAC is widely used in the flux modelling community (e.g. (Manders et al., 2017; Sauter et al., 2018). The surface resistance parameterizations are different for different land use types defined in the model. In DEPAC, three deposition pathways for the surface resistance are taken into account: – through the stomata15 – through the external leaf surface – through the soil DEPAC is extensively described in a technical report by Van Zanten et al. (2010). It also includes a compensation point for ammonia which is currently set to zero in PALM. For the passive particulate matter in the chemistry model, the land-use dependent deposition scheme of Zhang et al. (2001)20 has been implemented into PALM. The formulations have been chosen as they include an explicit dependence on aerosol size. For particulate matter, the deposition velocity is calculated by the gravitational settling or sedimentation velocity (mainly relevant for the larger particles), the aerodynamic resistance (see above) and the surface resistance. The sedimentation velocity mainly depends on particle properties, the gravitational acceleration and the viscosity coefficient of air. The formulation for the surface resistance is empirical with parameters that are based on a few field studies including the collection efficiencies for25 Brownian diffusion, impaction and interception, respectively, and a correction factor representing the fraction of particles that stick to the surface depending on the surface wetness. Further details can be found in Zhang et al. (2001). 2.3 Traffic emissions The chemistry model of PALM includes a module for reading gaseous and passive anthropogenic emission input from traffic sources and converting it to the appropriate format. These emission data can be provided in three possible levels of detail30 (LODs), depending on the amount of information available at the user’s disposal. With LOD 0, traffic emissions are parameter- ized based on emission factors specific to particular street types. All street segments contained in the domain will be classified 9 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. into “main” and “side” street segments. A mean surface emission flux tendency for each chemical species contained the ac- tive chemical mechanism, in kilograms per square meter per day, will be provided together with a weighting factor for main and side street emissions in the PALM parameter file. Street type classification based on Open StreetMap definitions (Open- StreetMap contributors, 2017) is to be included in the PALM static driver (Maronga et al., 2020). A diurnal profile derived from traffic counts is implemented to disaggregate total emissions into hourly intervals. Currently a default profile is applied to5 all species for main and side street segments, and details can be found in the on-line documentation for the PALM-4U chem- istry model (https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc). More detailed traffic emission data can be provided in gridded form in PALM-specific netCDF format (Maronga et al., 2020). LOD 1 accepts a spatially distributed annual emission data for each discretized street cell in the computation domain, which will be temporally disaggregated using sector-specific standard time factors. In addition, using LOD 2, the user can further introduce preprocessed emission data that are already temporally10 disaggregated, in hourly intervals, for instance. Future plans include expansion of the emission model to accommodate further modes of anthropogenic emissions such as domestic heating. 2.4 Initial and boundary conditions Lateral boundary conditions for chemical compounds can be chosen in the same way as the lateral boundary condition for other scalars, e.g. potential temperature, being either cyclic conditions or non-cyclic (Maronga et al., 2020). In most urban15 applications, chemistry requires non-cyclic boundary conditions, because cyclic conditions lead to accumulation of pollutants to the modelling domain if pollutant emissions exist. As part of the PALM-4U components, nesting has been implemented to chemistry module. In offline nesting, PALM can be coupled to a larger (meso, regional, or global) scale model to provide dynamic boundary conditions for the meteorological variables as well as air pollutants. As larger scale models do not fully resolve turbulence, a synthetic turbulence inflow generator has been introduced (Gronemeier et al., 2015).20 Initial concentrations of primary compounds to control the chemistry model are controlled by the chemistry namelist "&chemistry_parameters" in PALM parameter file. Options for prescribing initial conditions are available for both surface initial conditions and initial vertical profiles for the area or region of interest. There are no default initial concentrations and the user is responsible for providing these values based on, e.g., measured background concentration of primary chemical com- pounds for whom initial concentration are defined. These primary compounds must be part of the applied chemical mechanism.25 3 Chemistry model application In order to demonstrate the ability of the chemistry implementation, we performed a simulation for an entire daily cycle in a realistic urban environment and compared simulation results against observational data. To analyse the effect of different chemical mechanisms with different complexity on the resulting concentrations, we performed simulations with three chemical mechanisms and one passive case where only transport and dry-deposition was considered.30 10 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

CC BY 4.0 License. 3.1 Numerical setup description The PALM model system, version 6.0, revision 4450 and 4601 (only for flux profiles of chemical compounds), has been used in this study. Details of the dynamic core of the model are described in Maronga et al. (2015) and Maronga et al. (2020). The model was run for 24 hours from 00:00 UTC (0200 CEST 17 July 2017), to 24:00 UTC (02:00 CEST 18 July 2017) for a city quarter located around the Ernst-Reuter-Platz in Berlin, Germany. This particular day was chosen as it represents an ’ideal’5 Berlin summer day with mostly sunny with scattered clouds in the morning and passing clouds in the afternoon and evening hours. The temperature ranged between 289K to 298K with moderate winds predominantly from westerly direction. It was not a weekend, therefore, emissions from the traffic were not affected by the reduced traffic. In addition to near surface observations from online web sources Thorsen (2017), we also analysed radiosonde data from Lindenberg (Oolman, 2017) (last accessed on 30.07.2020), and aerosol backscatter observations from Ceilometer for 16 and 17 July 2017, to understand the vertical10 structure of the atmosphere in the area of interest. Ceilometer observations of aerosol back-scatter profiles were performed at the roof of the TU Campus Charlottenburg building (52.5123◦N, 13.3279◦E) as part of the Urban Climate Observatory (UCO) operated by the Chair of Climatology at Technische Universität Berlin for long-term observations of atmospheric processes in cities (Scherer et al., 2019a; Wiegner et al., 2002)) and contribute to the research program Urban Climate Under Change [UC]2 (Scherer et al., 2019b). Mixing layer heights were derived from the aerosol backscatter signal according to Geiß et al. (2017).15 Observations from radiosonde and Ceilometere showed strong showers on the previous days that resulted in a very well mixed (almost moist adiabatic) layer in the lower troposphere that lead to an almost constant potential temperature gradient above the inversion, therefore, there was no residual layer at mid-night on 17 July, when the model was initialised for a 24 hour run. The Ceilometer observations for 17 July, 2017, also did not show disturbances by clouds, the mixed layer top however, remained below 2000 m throughout the diurnal cycle. Fig. 2 shows the computational domain that covers an area of 6.71 km20 x 6.71 km (671 x 671 grid points) with a model top at 3.6 km above surface. The horizontal grid spacing in x and y direction is 10 m. In the vertical, with 312 layers, the grid spacing is 10 meters up to 2700 m, above which it increases by an expansion factor of 1.033 until the grid spacing in the z-direction reaches 40.0 m. Rayleigh damping has been used above 2500 m in order to weaken the effect of gravity waves above the boundary-layer top. A multigrid scheme has been used to calculate pressure perturbations in the prognostic equations for momentum (Maronga25 et al., 2015). A third order Runge-Kutta scheme (Williamson, 1980) has been used for time integration. The advection of momentum and scalars was discretized by a fifth-order advection scheme by Wicker and Skamarock (Wicker and Skamarock, 2002). Following Skamarock (2006); Skamarock and Klemp (2008), we employed a monotonic limiter for the advection of chemical species along the vertical direction in order to avoid unrealistically high concentrations within the poorly resolved cavities (e.g. courtyards represented by only a few grid points) which can occasionally occur due to stationary numerical30 oscillations near buildings. The topographic data with streets, buildings, water bodies, vegetation and other urban land surface features at a 10 m resolution has been processed for Berlin by German Space Agency (DLR) (Heldens et al., 2020). The building height data is based on CityGML data from FIS Broker Berlin (Fish-Broker, 2020) last accessed on 30.06.2020. If a surface element has 11 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

The black filled circles show the location of the observational monitoring stations of Wedding and Hardenbergplatz. vegetation, pavement or water, it is classified as a natural-type surface and it is treated by the land-surface model, while building surfaces are treated by the urban-surface model Resler et al. (2017); Maronga et al. (2020). With the exception of a few higher buildings above 50 m, most of the building height in the simulation domain is between 5 to 45 m whereas only few exceeds 60 m. The street types shown in Figure 2b are based on OpenStreetMap (OpenStreetMap contributors, 2017). The model domain5 includes 13 types of narrow, one-way and two-way roads. The width of the road/street is relevant as for the emission mode with LOD=0 (parameterized mode) emission factors vary with the street type. For the main streets we used an emission factor 1.667, while for the side streets the emission factor was 0.334. The simulation domain contains five types of vegetation categories that include grass and shrubs of different height. The three-dimensional vegetation parameters leaf-area density (LAD) representing leaves and branches and trunk have four vertical10 levels ranging from 0 to 3 m2 m−3 and 0 to 80 m2 m−3, respectively. Lake, river, pond and fountain categories are included in the domain for water type. Considering urban surface, soil type of the entire domain is classified as "coarse" whereas pavement types in the domain are defined with six different categories of asphalt, concrete and stones. The Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTMG) (Clough et al., 2005), which is included in PALM, has been used to calculate radiation fluxes and radiation heating rates. The surface roughness length is set according to the given building, vegetation,15 pavement and water types and based on the information from the static driver. Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) then provides surface fluxes of momentum (shear stress), and scalar quantities (heat, moisture) at the lower boundary condition. The application of MOST assumption on urban surfaces has not been thoroughly evaluated. However, similar studies for example 12 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. Letzel et al. (2008) and Gronemeier et al. (2020), show that LES results were in good agreement with a wind-tunnel data representing an urban setting. Based on these findings, it is assumed that MOST is applicable in the simulated urban surface. Three chemical mechanisms namely PHSTAT, SMOG and CBM4 along with one no-reaction case have been applied in this case study (Table 1). The most simple mechanism, PHSTAT, describes only the photostationary equilibrium between NO, NO2 and O3 and does not include formation of any secondary compounds. CBM4 (Gery et al., 1989) is the most complex5 mechanism currently included in PALM-4U and it includes VOC and HOx (hydrogen oxide radicals) chemistry and formation of ozone and further photochemical products. The SMOG photochemical mechanism was chosen as it contains a strongly simplified NOx-HOx-VOC chemistry with VOC just described by one single representative compound (Table 1). Due to a smaller number of species and reactions, SMOG is much faster compared to CBM4. Assuming that CBM4, due to its more complete representation of atmospheric chemistry, is10 more accurate, the objective to include SMOG is to assess computational efficiency at the cost of accuracy of the description of the VOC chemistry. In a fourth experiment, the same photostationary mechanism (PHSTAT) was used but with the gas-phase chemistry reactions turned off. The photochemical species were treated as passive tracers and only transport and dry deposition were allowed. The traffic emission data using the ’PARAMETERIZED’ option (LOD=0) are based on emission factors derived from15 HBEFA (Hauseberger and Rexeis, 2017) and traffic counts provided by the Senate Department for the Environment, Transport and Climate Protection of Berlin. A mean surface emission of 4745 µmol m−2 day−1 and 1326 µmol m−2 day−1 are applied for NO and NO2, respectively, and weights of 1.667 for main streets and 0.334 for side streets are applied for the current study. Considering the diurnal cycle of emissions a typical temporal profile of traffic emissions (see section S1 of the supplement), with maxima at 8:00 CEST and 18:00–19:00 CEST based on traffic counts at Ernst-Reuter-Platz was applied.20 Initial conditions and mean profiles of θ, q, u, v and w, soil moisture and soil temperature were obtained from output of the operational mesoscale weather prediction model COSMO-DE/D2 (COnsortium for Small scale MOdelling, (Baldauf et al., 2011) for 17 July 2017. The INIFOR tool was used to prepare these initial conditions in a format that can be read by PALM (Kadasch et al., 2020). At the lateral boundaries, cyclic boundary conditions are applied for the velocity components, θ, q and chemical compounds.25 The application of cyclic boundary conditions may be justified by low variability in wind direction with prevailing westerly winds throughout the major part of 17 July 2017 and the large extent of the urban area upwind of the model domain. One main reason for not applying boundary conditions from COSMO-DE/D2 was that it required large fetch to develop turbulence, as turbulence quantities are not supplied by the boundary conditions from the mesoscale COSMO-DE/D2 simulation. Further- more, chemistry fields were not availables for the lateral boundaries from COSMO-DE/D2. Thus, cyclic boundary condition30 were applied that ensure cyclic inflow of meteorological and chemistry variables that left the domain from the opposite lateral boundary. Therefore a continuous inflow and outflow of pollutants in and out of the simulation domain is assumed. This is reasonable, as the simulation domain is located in a large highly urbanised area. The initial profiles of pollutant concentration are based on the observed data of NO, NO and O3 from Berlin city. Initial concentrations of NO, NO2 and O3 above 495 m were set to 0.0, 2.0 and 40.0 ppb respectively.35 13 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. At the bottom boundary, a Dirichlet condition is applied whereas a Neumann condition is applied for e and p. At the top boundary, Dirichlet conditions are applied to flow and all scalars except for chemical compounds. Neumann boundary condition is applied at the top and bottom boundary for all chemical compounds. Moreover, a canopy drag coefficient Cd = 0.3 has been applied while the roughness is specified internally depending on vegetation type. 3.2 Observation stations5 The air quality measurements that are compared with the simulations are conducted at automated stations of the so-called BLUME network in Berlin Department for the Environment, Transport and Climate Protection (Senate-Berlin, 2017) (last access: 14 August 2017). Two stations, Wedding and Hardenbergplatz, (Fig. 2) are located within the model domain. The roadside air quality station at Hardenbergplatz is located at a busy junction with high traffic flow and in close proximity to the train and bus station. The station records only NO, and NO2. The height of the buildings in the vicinity of the station ranges from10 10 to 30 meters. The dense road network of small and big streets to the north, south and west of the station warrants transport of traffic-related pollutants towards Hardenbergplatz when the station is located downwind of these directions. To the north-east of the station is the Berlin Zoo and Tiergarten park that spread over 5.2 km2. Thus with a NE flow, the Hardenbergplatz air quality station would be downwind of the large vegetated area and less anthropogenic pollutants would be advected to the station, although the concentration of BVOC is expected to be larger. The background air quality station of Wedding is located15 to the north in the outskirts of the city away from heavy traffic flow. Wedding air quality station records PM10, NO, NO2 and O3. The city centre is located to the south of the station, so the station would likely record higher levels of NOx and PM10 during southerly flow. Both stations collect data every 5 minutes which are then averaged to hourly data and made available on the Senate department web pages (Senate-Berlin, 2017). 4 Results and discussion20 The results of the chemistry model simulations are presented for 20 hours from 0300 UTC (0500 CEST ) to 2300 UTC (0100 CEST 18 July 2017). All plots and data in this case study are presented in CEST (central European Summer Time). The simulation data was output every 10 minutes as instantaneous values and every 30 minutes as averages. Since observational data are available in hourly averaged data, we used the 30 minutes averaged model data for comparison with observations. For all other plots we used instantaneous data.25 4.1 Meteorology Figure 3 shows vertical profiles of potential temperature, mixing ratio, wind speed and wind direction over the diurnal cycle. The profiles of potential temperature indicate a vertically well-mixed boundary layer during daytime, evolving from approx- imately 500 meters at 7:00 CEST to more than 2300 m at 21:00 CEST, while in the evening hours the near-surface layer stabilises. The mixed-layer depth agrees fairly well with the observed values from Ceilometer measurements (horizontal bars30 in Fig. 3a), except for the late afternoon and evening hours, where the modelled boundary-layer depth is over-predicted by 14 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

Vertical profiles of a) potential temperature, b) mixing ratio, c) wind speed and d) wind direction, at different times from morning to midnight on 17 July 2017. The horizontal bars in a) indicate the boundary-layer height derived from Ceilometer observations. up to 15%. This can have various reasons, e.g. in our simulations we neglected larger-scale processes such as subsidence or mesoscale advection. The wind comes from westerly directions at a mean wind speeds of about 6–9ms−1 within the mixed layer. 4.2 Vertical mixing of NO2 and O3 Fig. 4 shows profiles of concentrations and vertical fluxes of NO, NO2, O3 and CO for the selected times of the diurnal cycle on5 17 July 2017. Profiles and fluxes of CO are added to represent transport characteristics of passive species. Positive fluxes with a negative vertical gradient can be observed for NO and NO2, indicating a net upward transport of the respective compounds from the surface towards higher levels during the entire diurnal cycle. The emitted NO from traffic sources oxidised to NO2 by reaction with the available O3: NO + O3→ NO2 + O2 (R1) .10 This leads to an increase of NO2 and a decrease of O3 within the boundary layer. As indicated by Fig. 4g) the growth of the boundary layer after sunrise leads to a downward transport of O3 since ozone concentrations in the residual layer are higher than within the mixed layer. At the same time photolysis of NO2 (R2) and photochemical formation of O3 (R3) by VOC chemistry retained and slightly increased the O3 concentration within the boundary layer as well as in the residual layer. NO2 + hν → NO + O(3P) (R2) ,15 O2 + O(3P)→ O3 + M (R3) . Throughout the diurnal course, near surface concentrations of NO are 1 to 2 ppb higher than the remaining mixed layer. At 9:00 CEST owing to emissions from traffic sources, the NO concentration increased from 3 ppb to 5 ppb in the first few meters above surface, then evenly dilutes in the shallow mixed layer and stabilises with a mixing ratio of 3 ppb. Besides the high NOx emissions in the morning hours this increase can also be attributed to the onset of NO2 photolysis (R2). During rest of the day,20 NO concentrations gradually reduces, mostly due to dilution by vertical mixing during further growth of the mixed layer as 15 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. Figure 4. Vertical profiles of species concentration for a) NO, b) NO2, c) O3 and d) CO, as well as their total vertical fluxes (e-h) over the diurnal cycle. well as the fast reaction with O3 (R1). The NO concentrations above the inversion are much lower and mostly influenced by the background levels thus making NO vertical flux positive Fig. 4e showing upward transport of NO. Unlike NO, the NO2 concentration profiles in Fig. 4b show only small differences in the morning hours (7:00 and 9:00 CEST). In the afternoon (12:00 and 17:00 CEST) when the convection is stronger, the NO2 concentration is the lowest due to the combined effect of upward vertical mixing indicated by Fig. 4f and photolysis of NO2 (R2).5 Reactions R1 – R3 between NO, NO2 and O3 do not result in a net gain of O3. However, OH radical chain reaction of VOCs result in the formation of excess NO2 (R4 and R5) and thus O(3P) (R2), that leads to a net O3 gain (Cao et al., 2019): OH + RH + O2→ RO2 (R4) , RO2 + NO→ RO + NO2 (R5) . In addition to reaction R3, the O3 levels within the mixed layer are also replenished through down-welling from above the10 inversion during the day which is evident from the negative flux profiles of O3 Fig. 4g. As a result O3 concentration gradually increased from 18 ppb at 07:00 CEST to 43 ppb at 17:00. In the evening hours (21:00 hour on wards), NO concentration reduced to 1 ppb near the surface while it is completely removed from the residual layer. In the reduced(no) solar radiation, NO2 photolysis (R2) slows-down(stops) whereas emission 16 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. Figure 5. YZ vertical cross-sections of NO2 and O3 simulated with CBM4 mechanism at 09:00 CEST on 17 July 2017. and limited R1 reaction (because of very low available NO) favours increase in the NO2 mixing ratio. This resulted in the highest near surface NO2 concentrations at 24:00 CEST in the nocturnal stable layer. In the well mixed residual layer above, the NO2 concentration at 24:00 CEST is up to 1 ppb lower than NO2 concentrations at 21:00 CEST. Ozone also reduced up to 3 ppb at 24:00 CEST but remained well mixed in the residual layer above the shallow nocturnal stable boundary layer. Carbon monoxide has been added to the analysis as a proxy to passive species Fig. 4d . In the morning hours concentration is the5 highest, that gradually reduced due to turbulent mixing in the rapidly growing mixed layer and due partly to dry deposition. Figure 5 shows YZ vertical cross sections at Hardenbergplatz for NO2 and O3. Turbulence and the growth of the mixed layer height caused downward vertical mixing and O3 entrainment near boundary layer top that resulted in increase of O3 concentration as well as in decrease of NO2 concentrations to 2.0 ppb. Near the ground, NO2 concentration is still of the order of 10 ppb. At the top of the boundary layer, the concentration of OH and HO2 were higher than in the surrounding areas,10 which indicates active NOx-VOC-O3 chemistry in the turbulent entrainment zone. 4.3 Spatial distribution of pollutants The spatial distribution of NO2 and O3 concentrations 5 m above surface (Fig. 6) are discussed for 9:00 and 21:00 CEST as simulated with the CBM4 mechanism. The concentrations of NOx, aldehyde and hydrocarbon species (not shown), which are emitted by road traffic, were high in the morning and evening hours due to stable conditions and high emissions.15 Most of the high NO2 concentrations in the morning hours (Fig. 6a) are predicted in the street canyons in the southern part of the simulation domain, where numerous buildings with a height of approximately 20 m are present (see Fig. 2a). In the street 17 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. Figure 6. Horizontal cross-sections of near surface NO2 and O3 concentrations at 09:00 and 21:00 hours on 17 July, 2017, simulated with CBM4 mechanism. The black square in "a)" indicates the location of the small domain presented in Fig. 7. Locations A and B in plot "c" indicates isolated street canyons plotted in Fig. 8. canyons of this area, wind speeds of less than 2 m s−1 were simulated below 20 m, while wind speeds were almost twice as high over the open areas in the northern part of the model domain (not shown). Therefore, emitted NOx is more diluted by advection over the open areas. Furthermore in the morning hours compared to the open spaces, vertical mixing and transport in 18 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. the street canyons is inhibited mainly due to delayed heating of the ground which is attributed to the shading of the surrounding buildings. Therefore O3 is predominantly titrated by reaction R1 (Fig. 6b) over the road network reducing its concentration to the order of 20 ppb, while over open spaces and vegetation (specially southern part of Tiergarten) a slightly higher O3 mixing ratio (27 ppb) is found. The initial O3 values near the surface were set to 10 ppb increasing to 40 ppb around 500 m above surface. Higher concentration of O3 (30 ppb) near the surface in the open spaces indicates higher vertical mixing and downward5 transport of O3 in the morning hours of the day. In the evening, however, NO2 distribution is somewhat more uniform over the entire road network (Fig. 6c). This is attributed to emissions from traffic with reduced or no photolysis of NO2 (R2) and titration of O3. Under the low wind conditions below 50 m, ventilation is reduced and leads to increase in NO2 over street crossings, main and side roads. Consequently, the NO2 concentration increased by 30% in the evening hours over roads and adjacent paved areas whereas over the vegetated areas (grass, crops, shrubs and trees), NO2 concentrations is around 5 ppb in10 the morning hours and reached up to 10 ppb in the evening hours. The daytime NOx-O3-VOC chemistry resulted in elevated O3 levels which increased by more than 100% as compared to the morning concentrations , mostly due to photochemical production of O3 (Reaction R2 and R3) during daytime. In the evening hours (Fig. 6d) , O3 is largely titrated by reaction R1 over the road network. In certain sections of the street canyons where micro-meteorological conditions are more favourable, O3 levels decreased to 20 ppb. However, in the open spaces and over vegetation with very low NO, the O3 concentration is of15 the order of 50 ppb. To provide an overview of the pollutant dispersion at the street level, a small section of the model domain (500 x 500 m) in the Hardenbergplatz area has been analysed (Fig. 7). The brown filled dot shows the location of Hardenbergplatz air quality station. This small urban section is characterised by typical urban environment with streets, paved areas, buildings with varying heights, and some vegetated areas of the Tiergarten located to the north-east. The dispersion of air pollutants in a street20 canyon generally depends on the aspect ratio (building height to street width ratio) and rate at which the street exchanges air vertically with the above roof-level atmosphere and laterally with connecting streets (N’Riain et al., 1998). Figure 7 shows the dispersion and chemical transformation of NO2 and O3 in the street canyons and surrounding areas. The vegetated area of Tiergarten north-east of the domain has relatively high O3 levels and small NO2 concentrations which is attributed to the low NO concentrations over the vegetation that lead to reduced O3 titration (R1). The model has emissions only from traffic25 sources and therefore availability of the primary species other than roads depends upon the dispersion of the primary chemical compounds such as NO. In the street canyons, O3 is titrated by NO by reaction R1 resulting in production of NO2. In the morning hours, NO2 concentration increases in some sections of the street canyons (location A, B, C Fig. 7a) which are located to the west/southwest of the tall buildings and thus lie under the shade of the building structures. Due to the particular street geometry, and flow dynamics above the urban canopy, these sections also experience weak wind conditions.30 The elevated NO2 concentrations are most probably due to the suppression of NO2 photolysis caused by buildings shade and increased residence time of NO and O3 due to very localised calm/near calm conditions in the the street canyons. The daytime NO-O3-VOC chemistry, significantly increases O3 concentration. In the evening hours when photolysis of NO2 is again suppressed, the NOx and O3 chemistry mostly controlled by reaction R1 and wind speed in the street canyons. The street sections (locations D,E,F in Fig. 7c) with low wind/calm conditions experience relatively elevated NO2 and low O3 levels as35 19 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. Figure 7. Near surface NO2 and O3 concentrations in the street canyons near Hardenbergplatz, simulated with CBM4 mechanism at 09:00 and 21:00 hours on 17 July, 2017. The wind vectors in "a)" and "c)" shows horizontal wind speed 5 m above surface. The brown filled dot indicates the location of Hardenbergpltz. Grey shading indicates building height. under calm conditions NO has enough residence time to titrate O3 and thus contribute towards increased NO2 concentrations. Streets with stronger winds over the open spaces (train tracks, Tiergarten area), experience lower than average NO2 levels. At some locations, PALM simulated unrealistically high NO2 concentrations. Fig. 8 shows time series plots along with xy cross-section of the street canyons (in the inset) where the model simulated high NO2 concentrations at location A and B 20 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

We selected four grid points at location A and randomly five grid points from the discontinued street canyon at location B. During the day, NO2 concentrations remain up to 50 ppb, however, after 18:00 CEST, NO2 concentrations increase rapidly at both locations. By 21:00 CEST, NO2 concentration at location A is on the order of 75 ppb Fig. 8a, whereas, at location B NO2 levels ranges between 65 to 90 ppb Fig. 8b. At 01:00 CEST, the NO2 concentration at both locations A and B reaches 150 ppb and 275 ppb respectively.5 Due to the relative coarse grid resolution of 10m, as applied in this study, street canyons are partly only resolved by one or two grid points and sometimes enclosed cavities occur. Within such geometries the flow is only poorly resolved by the numerical grid, meaning that the bulk of the transport is parametrized by the subgrid model. However, as the subgrid TKE is also very low in such narrow canyons or cavities (not shown), the total vertical transport is rather low, especially in the evening hours when the surface layer stabilises. If, however, surface emissions are still high within such street canyons, chemical10 compounds can accumulate and will not be sufficiently transported away. Here, we emphasise that such accumulation of compounds cannot be observed with higher grid resolution of 1− 2m where street canyons are sufficiently resolved by the numerical grid. 21 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

All six plots exhibit a clear signal of gradual boundary layer growth from morning to evening. The concentrations of both NO2 and O3 differ between the three chemical mechanisms which can be attributed to their different levels of complexity and different description of the reactions resulting in either photochemical equilibrium or net formation of ozone and other photochemical products.5 Due to the photostationary state, there is no net O3 production in PHSTAT mechanism (Fig. 9a and b). In the morning hours despite reaction R1 that consumed most of the NO, the NO2 concentration is slightly reduced to 7 ppb by 7:00 CEST compared to its initial near surface background levels of 10 ppb. The small drop in NO2 concentration is attributed to the mixing of NO2 within the shallow mixed layer reaching 500 m in depth. Titration of O3 by NO, consequently reduces O3 concentrations to 15 ppb. After 07:00 CEST, photodissociation leads to decrease of NO2 to very low levels (2-4 ppb) 50 m above surface. However,10 NO2 concentration remains on the order of 6 to 7 ppb close to the surface due to emissions from roads and NOx-VOC-HOx chemistry. Consequently O3 concentration peaks between 13:00 to 18:00 CEST by reaction R3. Above the rapidly growing mixed layer, the background concentration remained 2 and 40 ppb for NO2 and O3 respectively. In the evening and night time emissions from traffic, suppression of NO2 photolysis (R2) and a slow R1 reaction increases NO2 concentrations near the surface up to 20 ppb, while O3 concentration is suppressed to less than 15 ppb due primarily to reaction R1. Above the stable15 nocturnal boundary layer the NO2 is well mixed in the near neutral residual layer with a concentration of around 10 ppb, while due to absence of NO in the residual layer, and downward transport of background O3 concentration through the entrainment zone, the O3 concentration increases by 30 ppb in the residual layer. Photolysis of NO2, daytime NOx-VOC chemistry in the case of the SMOG (Fig. 9c and d) and CBM4 (Fig. 9e and f) mechanism result in Ox production and increased O3 levels during the day with maximum values in the afternoon. Various20 VOC reactions form peroxy radicals that oxidise NO to NO2 and other nitrate products help increasing O3 concentration where as CO, CO2, and HNO3 acts as atmospheric sink to aldehydes, NOx and O3 in SMOG. In the CBM4 mechanism NO2 levels are reduced as much as 40% between 12:00 to 19:00 CEST whereas O3 concentration increases with almost the same percentage. Since no reactions leading to a net production of O3 are considered for the pho- tostationary state (PHSTAT mechanism), the maximum ozone concentrations is determined by the photolysis of NO2 and is25 therefore lower than for the SMOG and CBM4 mechanism. In all three mechanisms, a gradual decay of O3 is found in the evening (after 20:00 CEST). Near the surface, the interaction of NOx with O3 chemistry is more pronounced. During the daytime specially in the morning hours , down-welling of O3 in the entrainment zone also contributes to increase in O3 concentration in the mixed layer. In the evening, after the collapse of the mixed layer, a well-mixed residual layer with near-uniform pollutant concentration can be found above the shallow30 stably stratified nocturnal boundary layer. Although behaviour of NOx and O3 is essentially the same in all three mechanisms, however, the difference is more evident in CBM4 because we see a more pronounced diurnal course of O3 in CBM4. 22 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

CC BY 4.0 License. 4.5 Comparison of pollutant concentrations with observations The observation data from Wedding and Hardenbergplatz is compared with the mean concentrations of the modelled NO, NO2, and O3 from five points in the vicinity of the Wedding and Hardenbergplatz stations (Fig. 10). Error bars indicate standard deviation at every hour in the time series data from the five points. Ozone is not measured at Hardenbergplatz, and therefore, the time series curve of the observed O3 is not included in Figure 10 and the analysis at Hardenbergplatz is restricted to NO5 and NO2 species only. The three mechanisms (PHSTAT, SMOG and CBM4) are able to reproduce the diurnal cycle of NO, NO2, and O3 with reasonable accuracy. CBM4 shows a more pronounced diurnal course than SMOG and PHSTAT. The timing of the maximum ozone concentration is reproduced much better in CBM4 than SMOG and PHSTAT. Since PHSTAT does not include any net O3 formation, the maximum O3 concentration occurs at the time of maximum solar elevation. However, SMOG and CBM410 include photochemical ozone production which leads to higher maximum ozone concentrations. A shift of the maximum ozone concentration from local noon to later afternoon is in agreement to observations. Due to a more detailed description of NOx- VOC-HOx chemistry this process is described more realistically for CBM4 than for SMOG. All three mechanisms failed to realistically simulate evening peaks in NOx (NO and NO2) concentrations and the corresponding low O3 concentrations. This can possibly be related to the slow cooling of the surface as described earlier which results in less pronounced stable layer near15 the ground after sunset. Since O3 is inversely related to NOx, the underestimated NOx-concentration in the evening leads to reduced titration of O3, therefore, results in higher levels of O3. Another important reason for bias in the model is the missing emission sources. We utilized emission information only from traffic sources, however, contribution from industry, household and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) is ignored which is a main source of uncertainty in the model. The no-reaction case only contains transport and dry deposition of NOx. Without chemical reactions, NO continues to20 increase, which is primarily due to the lack of chemical sinks in combination with the application of cyclic boundary conditions. In contrast to the cases with chemical reactions, NO2 is lower than NO since there is no conversion of NO to NO2. Despite titration by NO, a very slow increase in the near surface O3 in the morning hours can be attributed to the downward mixing from the residual layer during the growth of the mixed layer. 24 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint.

Time series plots of the near surface NO, NO2, and O3 concentrations from four mechanisms (NO-REAC, PHSTAT, SMOG, CBM4) and observations from 5:00 CEST (17 July) to 01:00 CEST (18 July 2017). The left column (panel plots a, c and e ) shows time series from Wedding, and the right column (plots b, d, and f) shows time series plots from Hardenbergplatz. 4.6 Computational efficiency Chemistry models are known for utilising relatively large amount of computational power and the same applies to the chem- istry model implemented in PALM model system 6.0. This is mainly due to the complexity in solving the stiff Jacobian matrix 25 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. Table 2. Increase in computational expense of a simulation with PASSIVE, PHSTAT, SMOG and CBM4 relative to a simulation without chemistry. For Case A the simulations for a model domain with 96 x 96 x 320 grid points and a grid width of 10 m. For Case B the simulations were performed for a model domain with 671 x 671 x 312 grid points and a grid width of 10 m. Both runs were made in scalar mode for one full day. ’transp. only’ indicates the relative expense when solely the transport of the considered compounds is calculated and chemical transformation is switched off, ’full’ refers to the run with transport as well as chemical transformations. Increase in computational time (%) Mechanism Var. species Reactions Case A (transp. only) Case B (transp. only) Case A (full) Case B (full) PASSIVE 2 0 20 – – – PHSTAT 3 2 30 28 50 63 SMOG 13 12 120 – 190 310 CBM4 32 81 310 – 550 650 because reaction rates of chemical species vary greatly that leads to a time-step much smaller than meteorological parameters, therefore the computation speed of the entire system is largely effected. The simulation of the chemical reactions can take as much as 90% of the total computational time in the calculation of an online-coupled simulation (Cao et al., 2019). The compu- tation time of chemistry increases with increasing number of the chemical compounds and the number of chemical reactions in a given chemical mechanism. Table 2 shows comparison of the four chemical mechanisms relative to the meteorology only5 simulation on two different high performance computing systems and two different single domain extents. Case A is performed on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (IMK-IFU) cluster. For Case A, we used a simulation domain with 96x96x320 grid points and dx=dy=dz=10 m and 96 CPU’s of the intel ivy bridge processors. Case B was performed at the North-German Super computing Alliance (HLRN)-Berlin. The domain size and configuration has been provided in section 3.1. The model runs have been performed with 784 CPUs on Intel Cascade Lake Platinum 9242 CPUs (CLX-AP) on standard96 partition. Both10 cases have been integrated for 24 hours. Due to the limited computational resources, the ’transp. only’ option (i.e. no-reaction; species used as passive scalars only) for all mechanisms was applied only for case A. For case B, ’transp. only’ simulation run was performed only for PHSTAT mechanism. Results show significant increase in the computational cost relative to in- crease in number of reactions and chemical compounds in different chemical mechanisms. The comparison of ’transp. only’ and ’(full)’ for Case A ( Table 2) shows that the transport of additional scalar variables is even more expensive compared to15 the computation of the chemical transformation. In the same way comparison of ’transp. only’ of case B (PHSTAT only) with ’(full)’ suggest that computation expense of only transport of additional passive scalars is almost same as the computation of the chemical transformation. Although ’transp. only’ data of all mechanisms is not available for case B, however, presumably results would not be much different than ’transp. only’ for case A and case B. Given the highest number of chemical compounds and consequently the number of reactions, CBM4 happens to be the20 most resource intensive mechanism which is 5.5 times more expensive than a plain meteorology-only simulation for the small domain (case A), and 6.5 times more expensive for the large domain simulation (case B). Considering the high computational 26 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. resource requirement of chemistry coupled LES simulations, it is important to put extra effort in the design of the simulation and selection of the appropriate chemical mechanisms. 5 Concluding remarks We have outlined the structure and important features of a chemistry model that has been added to the PALM model system 6.0 as part of PALM-4U (PALM for urban applications) components and coupled to the PALM model core. PALM model system5 6.0, is the first LES model that can simulate chemical transformation, advection and deposition of air pollutants for larger and realistically shaped urban areas (Maronga et al., 2019). PALM 6.0, offers many advanced features, which were not included in other LES models, for example self-nesting and large-scale forcing for chemical species, flexibility of choice in selection and generation of gas-phase chemistry mechanisms with the KPP preprocessor, and the availability of the chemistry model in both, RANS and LES mode.10 The results of the presented case study demonstrate the ability of chemistry model to predict photochemical reactions, along with advection and deposition of pollutants. The difference between reactive and non-reactive case clearly indicates that invoking reactive chemistry is of critical importance to accurately predict pollutant concentrations at the micro-scale. The simulated concentrations follow the observed diurnal cycle of the pollutants. However, the weak agreement warrants an improvement in the description of the parameterized emissions, the large-scale forcing and model resolution.15 Especially with coarse grid resolution some street canyons are only poorly resolved by the numerical grid, occasionally leading to the situation that street canyons are only one grid point wide or isolated cavities occur. However, within such enclosed cavities the flow is only poorly resolved too, meaning that the total transport of energy and matter is only small, especially under stable conditions. Emissions at such enclosed geometries may result in unrealistically high concentrations of primary compounds like NOx. With increasing grid resolution such narrow street canyons will be better represented on the20 numerical grid, lowering the risk that high emissions coincide with regions where the flow is only poorly resolved. Hence, especially for lower grid resolutions, we recommend to carefully inspect the concentration output to treat high concentrations in the data analysis adequately. The computational cost of the chemistry coupled simulations largely depends on the number of chemical compounds and the number of chemical reactions. The transport of additional scalar variables are found more expensive than the computation of the25 chemical transformation. Considering the high computational demand of chemistry coupled LES simulations, it is important that users should be careful in the choice of the chemistry mechanism for their specific needs. The chemistry model implemented in PALM is under continuous development, new features are being added and current features are being improved both in terms of efficiency and accuracy. We plan to further extend the model chemistry by implementing an advanced biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emission scheme, emission parameterization of30 residential heating, biogenic pollen emission, transport and deposition scheme. Moreover the chemistry model will be further improved by including a simplified scheme for ultra-fine particles (UFP) besides the one already implemented in SALSA (Kurppa et al., 2019). Additionally, chemical boundary conditions, road-re-suspension processes, wet-deposition processes of 27 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-286 Preprint. Discussion started: 25 September 2020 c© Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. air pollutants and a photolysis parameterization based on shading information will be implemented in the chemistry model. We also plan to provide a more complex and detailed chemistry for the RANS mode, while for the LES mode, currently only strongly simplified mechanisms are possible due to computational constraints.
