Migda et al. 1 Introduction Let N, R denote the set of positive integers and all real numbers, respectively. In this paper, we assume a, b : N → R, r : N → R \ {0}, f : R → R, σ : N → N, lim n→∞ σ(n) = ∞, and consider the second-order discrete equation with quasidiffer- ences of the form Δ(rnΔxn) = an f (xσ(n)) + bn . (E) By a solution of Eq. (E), we mean a sequence x which satisfies the equality (E) for all large n. Let us note that a particular case of Eq. (E) is the well-known Sturm–Liouville difference equation Δ(rnΔxn) = anxn+1, (1) which has many applications in mathematical physics, matrix theory, control theory or discrete variational theory. Equation (1) has been extensively studied bymany authors, especially with regard to the oscillation, disconjugacy and boundary value problems, see, for example, [1–3,5,6,8–11,20]. Several results devoted to asymptotic properties of (1) and for slightly more general equations can be found in [2,7,12,17–19,23–26]. In the presented paper, using the Schauder’s-type fixed point theorem, we establish conditions under which for a given sequence y, which solvesΔ(rnΔyn) = bn , Eq. (E) possesses a solution x such that xn = yn + o(un), (2) where u is a positive, nonincreasing sequence. If Eq. (2) is satisfied, then x is called a solution with prescribed asymptotic behavior, and y is called an approximative solu- tion of (E). Taking different sequences u, wemay control the degree of approximation. In particular, if un = ns for some fixed s ∈ (−∞, 0], then we have harmonic approx- imation. If un = αn for some fixed α ∈ (0, 1), then we get geometric approximation. We believe that very strong geometric approximation is important from a numerical point of view. It is worth noticing that our results are new even in the casewhen un = 1. Wepresent also an application of the obtained results to the study of asymptotic peri- odicity of solutions to Eq. (E). The study of the existence of periodic or asymptotically periodic solutions is a very important topic in the qualitative theory of difference equa- tions because of its many applications in mathematical biology, chemistry, physics, economics and other fields, see, e.g., [1,13]. The existence of asymptotically periodic solutions of Eq. (E) was considered, for example, in [4,16,21,22] or [25]. We also apply our results to the study of asymptotic properties of bounded solutions to discrete Sturm–Liouville Eq. (1). Moreover, using the Sturm separation theorem and our results we obtain some nonoscillation criteria for Eq. (1). The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce some preliminary lem- mas. In Sect. 3, we study the problem of the existence of solutions with prescribed asymptotic behavior. In Sect. 4, we apply our results to the study of asymptotically periodic solutions. Section 5 is devoted to the study of solutions to discrete Sturm– 123 Properties of Solutions of Generalized Sturm–Liouville… 3113 Liouville Eq. (1). In Sect. 6, the proof of Theorem 1 and some additional remarks are presented. 2 Preliminaries The space of all sequences x : N → R we denote by RN. If x ∈ RN, then |x | denotes the sequence defined by |x |(n) = |xn| and ‖x‖ = sup{|xn| : n ∈ N}. We will use the convention ∑n i=k di = 0 whenever n < k; moreover, we will use the following notation: r∗, r̂ : N → R, r∗n = n−1∑ i=1 1 ri , r̂n = max{|r∗1 |, |r∗2 |, . . . , |r∗n+1|}. The sequence r̂ we introduce for technical reasons. One of them is the following important property of r̂ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ k∑ i=n 1 ri ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ k∑ i=1 1 ri − n−1∑ i=1 1 ri ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 2̂rk for k ≥ n. (3) Note that if r > 0, then r̂n = r∗n+1 for any n. In the proofs of the main results, we will need some lemmas which are presented below. The straightforward proof of these lemmas we leave to the reader. Lemma 1 A sequence y is a solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn if and only if there exist real constants c1, c2 such that yn = n−1∑ j=1 1 r j j−1∑ i=1 bi + c1 n−1∑ j=1 1 r j + c2 for any n. Lemma 2 If ∑∞ k=1 r̂k |xk | < ∞, then for any n ∈ N we have Δ ( rnΔ ( ∞∑ k=n xk k∑ i=n 1 ri )) = xn . Lemma 3 If n ∈ N and ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |xi | < ∞, then Δ ( rnΔ ( ∞∑ k=n 1 rk ∞∑ i=k xi )) = xn . 123 3114 J. Migda et al. Lemma 4 If x : N → R, u : N → (0,∞), Δu ≤ 0, and ∞∑ k=1 r̂k |xk | uk < ∞, then ∞∑ k=n xk k∑ i=n 1 ri = o(un). Lemma 5 If x : N → R, u : N → (0,∞), Δu ≤ 0, and ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k |xi | < ∞, then ∞∑ k=n 1 rk ∞∑ i=k xi = o(un). Lemma 6 If g, w : N → [0,∞), ∑∞j=1 g j < ∞, and n ∈ N, then ∞∑ k=n wk ∞∑ j=k g j = ∞∑ k=n gk k∑ j=n w j . 3 Solutions with Prescribed Asymptotic Behavior In this section, in Theorem1,we present ourmain result.We establish conditions under which for a given solution y of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn and a given positive, nonincreasing sequence u there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(un). Next, we present various consequences of Theorem 1. The proof of Theorem 1 is presented in Sect. 6. Theorem 1 Assume y is a solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn, u : N → (0,∞), Δu ≤ 0, (4) q ∈ N, α ∈ (0,∞), U = ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α], (5) (a) ∞∑ k=1 r̂k |ak | uk < ∞ or (b) ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k |ai | < ∞, (6) and f is continuous and bounded on U. Then, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(un). We say that a sequence y ∈ RN is f -regular if there exist an index q and a positive number α such that f is continuous and bounded on the set ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α]. It is clear that if f is continuous onR, then any bounded sequence is f -regular. Hence, the following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1. 123 Properties of Solutions of Generalized Sturm–Liouville… 3115 Corollary 1 Assume (4), (6), f is continuous and y is a bounded solutionof the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn. Then, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(un). In the next corollary, we present a result concerning harmonic approximation. Corollary 2 Assume y is an f -regular solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn, s ∈ (−∞, 0], τ ∈ [s,∞), r−1n = O(nτ ), and ∞∑ n=1 n1+τ−s |an| < ∞. (7) Then, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(ns). Proof Let un = ns for any n. Choose a positive constant M such that |r−1k | ≤ Mkτ for any k. Using Lemma 6, we get ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k |ai | ≤ M ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ i=k kτ−s |ai | ≤ M ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ i=k iτ−s |ai | = M ∞∑ k=1 k1+τ−s |ak | < ∞. Now, using Theorem 1, we obtain the result. Remark 1 If τ ∈ [s,∞), γ = 2+ τ − s, then, by [15, Section 6], any of the following conditions lim inf n→∞ n ( |an| |an+1| − 1 ) > γ, lim sup n→∞ ln |an| ln n < −γ, lim inf n→∞ n ln |an| |an+1| > γ imply ∞∑ n=1 n1+τ−s |an| < ∞. The following result is devoted to geometric approximation. Corollary 3 Assume y is an f -regular solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn, τ ∈ R, r−1n = O(nτ ), and lim sup n→∞ n √ |an| < β < 1. (8) Then, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(βn). Proof Let u be a sequence defined by un = βn . It is easy to see that r̂n = O(nτ+1). Hence, lim sup n→∞ n √ r̂n|an| un < 1. 123 3116 J. Migda et al. Therefore, the assertion is a consequence of Theorem 1. So far, we did not impose any conditions on the sequence b. Now, we assume that b is “small.” That allows us to obtain simpler asymptotic behavior of solutions of Eq. (E). Namely, we may replace solutions y of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn by solutions of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = 0. Theorem 2 Assume (4), (a′) ∞∑ k=1 r̂k(|ak | + |bk |) uk < ∞, or (b′) ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k (|ai | + |bi |) < ∞. (9) and y is an f -regular solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = 0. Then, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(un). Proof Choose an index q and a positive number α such that f is continuous and bounded on U = ∞⋃ n=q [yn − α, yn + α]. Choose a number α′ ∈ (0, α), and let β = α − α′. Define sequences v, y′ by vn = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ ∑∞ k=n bk ∑k i=n 1 ri in case (a′) ∑∞ k=n 1 rk ∑∞ i=k bi in case (b ′) , y′n = yn + vn . Using Lemma 4 or Lemma 5, we get vn = o(un). Hence, there exists an index q ′ ≥ q such that |vn| ≤ β for any n ≥ q ′. Let U ′ = ∞⋃ n=q ′ [y′n − α′, y′n + α′]. If t ∈ U ′, then there exists an index k ≥ q ′ such that |t − y′k | ≤ α′. Then, |t − yk | = |t − y′k + y′k − yk | ≤ |t − y′k | + |y′k − yk | ≤ α′ + |vk | ≤ α′ + β = α. Hence, U ′ ⊂ U . Therefore, f is continuous and bounded on U ′. Using Lemma 2 or Lemma 3, we get Δ(rnΔvn) = bn . Thus, Δ(rnΔy ′ n) = Δ(rnΔyn) + Δ(rnΔvn) = 0 + bn = bn . By Theorem 1, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = y′n + o(un). Then, xn = yn + vn + o(un) = yn + o(un). 123 Properties of Solutions of Generalized Sturm–Liouville… 3117 The following harmonic approximation case of Theorem 2 generalizes [17, Theo- rem 1]. Corollary 4 Assume (7), y is an f -regular solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = 0, and ∞∑ n=1 n1+τ−s |bn| < ∞. Then, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(ns). Proof Let un = ns for any n. Similarly, as in the proof of Corollary 2 we get ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k (|ai | + |bi |) < ∞. Hence, the assertion is a consequence of Theorem 2. Below we get the geometric approximation case of Theorem 2. Corollary 5 Assume y is an f -regular solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = 0, τ ∈ R, r−1n = O(nτ ), and lim sup n→∞ n √ |an| + |bn| < β < 1. Then, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + o(βn). Proof As in the proof of Corollary 3, we have lim sup n→∞ n √ r̂nβ−n(|an| + |bn|) < 1. Using Theorem 2, with un = βn , we get the result. If the function f is continuous on R and the sequence r∗ is bounded, we obtain an especially simple case of Theorem 2. The presented result generalizes [16, Theorem 2.1]. Corollary 6 Assume (4), f is continuous, the sequence r∗ is bounded, and ∞∑ k=1 |ak | + |bk | uk < ∞. Then, for any real constants c, d there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = cr∗n + d + o(un). Proof The boundedness of r∗ implies the boundedness of r̂ . Hence, ∞∑ k=1 r̂k(|ak | + |bk |) uk < ∞. 123 3118 J. Migda et al. Assume c, d ∈ R. By Lemma 1, the sequence yn = cr∗n + d is a solution of the equationΔ(rnΔyn) = 0. Moreover, y is bounded. Hence, using Theorem 2, we obtain the result. As we mentioned before, Theorem 1 generalizes [17, Theorem 1], [16, Theorem 2.1], and [16, Theorem 2.2]. Below we present an example illustrating Theorem 1. None of these theorems can be applied to the equation given in this example. Example 1 Assume s ∈ (−1, 0], rn = (−1)nn, an = (−1)n (n + 1)2 ⎛ ⎝ n−1∑ j=1 (−1) j j + 1 n2 ⎞ ⎠ bn = (−1)n 3n + 4 n(n + 2)2 , and σ(n) = n, un = ns, yn = n−1∑ k=1 (−1)k k , f (t) = { 1 t , for t = 0, 1, for t = 0 . Then, Eq. (E) takes the form Δ((−1)nnΔxn) = an f (xn) + (−1)n 3n + 4 n(n + 2)2 . (10) By Lemma 1, the sequence y is a solution of Δ((−1)nnΔyn) = 0. Obviously, y is convergent and f -regular. There exists a positive constant M such that |an| ≤ M (n + 1)2 for any n ∈ N. Using the formula ∑∞j=k 1j( j+1) = 1k , we obtain ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ j=k (|a j | + |b j |) ≤ ∞∑ k=1 1 k1+s ∞∑ j=k ( M ( j + 1)2 + 3 j + 4 j( j + 2)2 ) ≤ ∞∑ k=1 1 k1+s ∞∑ j=k M + 7 j( j + 1) = (M + 7) ∞∑ k=1 1 k2+s < ∞, Hence, by Corollary 2, there exists a solution x of (10) such that xn = yn + o(un). The sequence xn = yn + n−2 is such a solution. Note that theorem [17, Theorem 1] cannot be applied to Eq. (10) because the condition r > 0 is not satisfied. Moreover, since the sequences r∗ and b are not periodic, theorems [16, Theorem 2.1] and [16, Theorem 2.2] also cannot be applied to Eq. (10). 123 Properties of Solutions of Generalized Sturm–Liouville… 3119 4 Asymptotically Periodic Solutions In this section, we present the application of the previously obtained results to the study of asymptotic periodicity of solutions to Eq. (E). The presented results generalize the main results of [16]. In thefirst two corollaries,we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of asymptotically periodic solutions. The following result is a consequence of Corollary 6. Corollary 7 Assume f is continuous, u : N → (0,∞), Δu ≤ 0, ω ∈ N, (11) the sequence r∗ is ω-periodic, and ∞∑ k=1 |ak | + |bk | uk < ∞. (12) Then, for any real constants c, d there exists an asymptotically ω-periodic solution x of (E) such that xn = cr∗n + d + o(un). Corollary 8 Assume (11), f is continuous, the sequence r∗ is bounded, y is an ω- periodic solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn, and ∞∑ k=1 |ak | uk < ∞. (13) Then, for any real constant d there exists an asymptotically ω-periodic solution x of (E) such that xn = yn + d + o(un). Proof For any d ∈ R, the sequence d + yn is a bounded solution of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = bn . Using Corollary 1, we obtain the result. The following example illustrates Corollary 8. Example 2 Let rn = n2, f (t) = t , σ(n) = n, an = −1 (n + 1)(n + 2)(3 + 2(−1)n + n−1) , bn = 4(−1) n (2n2 + 2n + 1). Then, Eq. (E) takes the form Δ(n2Δxn) = −xn (n + 1)(n + 2)(3 + 2(−1)n + n−1) + 4(−1) n (2n2 + 2n + 1). (14) Let yn = 3 + 2(−1)n, un = 1√ n . 123 3120 J. Migda et al. Then, y is a 2-periodic solution of the equation Δ(n2Δxn) = bn . Obviously, the sequence r∗ is bounded and the condition (13) is satisfied. Hence, by Corollary 8, there exists an asymptotically 2-periodic solution x of Eq. (14) such that xn = yn + o(un). Indeed, the sequence xn = 3 + 2(−1)n + n−1 is such a solution. 5 Sturm–Liouville Discrete Equations Now, we apply our results to discrete Sturm–Liouville equation Δ(rnΔxn) = anxn+1. (15) First, we present some results concerning asymptotic properties of bounded solutions. Next, we give some nonoscillation criteria. Theorem 3 Assume u : N → (0,∞), Δu ≤ 0, (16) and ∞∑ k=1 r̂k |ak | uk < ∞ or ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k |ai | < ∞. (17) Then, for any bounded solution y of the equation Δ(rnΔyn) = 0 (18) there exists a solution x of (15) such that xn = yn + o(un). Proof Taking bn = 0, σ(n) = n + 1 for any n ∈ N, and f (t) = t for any t ∈ R and using Corollary 1, we get the result. Note that, by Lemma 1, a sequence y is a solution of the Eq. (18) if and only if there exist real constants c, d such that yn = cr∗n + d, where r∗n = n−1∑ i=1 1 ri . In particular, any constant sequence is a solution of (18). If the sequence r∗ is bounded, then any solution of (18) is bounded. On the other hand, if r∗ is unbounded, then the only bounded solutions of (18) are constant. Corollary 9 Assume (16), the sequence r∗ is bounded, and ∞∑ k=1 |ak | uk < ∞. 123 Properties of Solutions of Generalized Sturm–Liouville… 3121 Then, for any real constants c, d there exists a solution x of (15) such that xn = cr∗n + d + o(un). Proof Since the sequence r∗ is bounded, the sequence r̂n = max{|r∗1 |, |r∗2 |, . . . , |r∗n+1|} is bounded, too. Hence, ∞∑ k=1 r̂k |ak | uk < ∞. Let c, d ∈ R. Since the sequence r∗ is bounded, the sequence cr∗n + d is a bounded solution of (18). Using Theorem 3, we obtain the result. From Corollary 2, we get the result on harmonic approximation. Corollary 10 If s ∈ (−∞, 0], τ ∈ [s,∞), r−1n = O(nτ ), and ∑∞ n=1 n 1+τ−s |an| < ∞, then for any bounded solution y of (18) there exists a solution x of (15) such that xn = yn + o(ns). Analogously, from Corollary 3 we get the geometric approximation. Corollary 11 Assume τ ∈ R, r−1n = O(nτ ), and lim supn→∞ n √|an| < β < 1. Then, for any bounded solution y of (18) there exists a solution x of (15) such that xn = yn + o(βn). If c, d ∈ R and the sequence r∗ is bounded, then the sequence cr∗ + d is a bounded solution of (18). Hence, from Corollary 10, we obtain Corollary 12 If s ∈ (−∞, 0], τ ∈ [s,∞), r−1n = O(nτ ), ∑∞ n=1 n 1+τ−s |an| < ∞, and the sequence r∗ is bounded, then for any real constants c, d there exists a solution x of (15) such that xn = cr∗n + d + o(ns). A sequence y ∈ RN is said to be nonoscillatory if yn yn+1 > 0 for any large n. In the other case, the sequence y is said to be oscillatory.We say that Eq. (15) is nonoscillatory if all its nontrivial solutions are nonoscillatory. By the Sturm separation theorem, see, for example, [13, Theorem 6.5], either all solutions of (15) are oscillatory or Eq. (15) is nonoscillatory. In particular, if there exists a convergent solution of (15) with nonzero limit, then Eq. (15) is nonoscillatory. From our results, we can get some sufficient conditions for the existence of convergent solutions. Combining these conditions and the Sturm separation theorem, we obtain some nonoscillation criteria for Eq. (15). Corollary 13 Assume τ ∈ [0,∞), r−1n = O(nτ ), and ∑∞ n=1 n 1+τ |an| < ∞. Then, Eq. (15) is nonoscillatory. Corollary 14 Assume τ ∈ [0,∞), r−1n = O(nτ ),α ∈ (−∞,−2−τ), and an = O(nα). Then, Eq. (15) is nonoscillatory. Corollary 15 If τ ∈ R, r−1n = O(nτ ), and lim supn→∞ n √|an| < 1, then Eq. (15) is nonoscillatory. 123 3122 J. Migda et al. 6 The proof of Theorem 1 and additional remarks The proof of Theorem 1 is based on the following Schauder-type fixed point lemma. This lemma is a consequence of the proof of [14, Theorem 1]. Lemma 7 Let y be a real sequence, and letρ be apositive sequencewhich is convergent to zero. Define a metric space (X , d) by X = {x ∈ RN : |xn − yn| ≤ ρn for any n ∈ N}, d(x, z) = sup n∈N |xn − zn|. Then, for any continuous map H : X → X there exists a point x in X such that Hx = x. Now, we provide the proof of Theorem 1. Proof For n ∈ N and x ∈ RN, let F(x)(n) = an f (xσ(n)). (19) Let Y = {x ∈ RN : |y − x | ≤ α}. Choose a positive constant L , such that | f (t)| ≤ L (20) for any t ∈ U . For n ∈ N, let ρn = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 2L ∑∞ k=n r̂k |ak | in case (a) L ∑∞ k=n 1 |rk | ∑∞ i=k |ai | in case (b). In case (a), it is easy to see that ρn = o(un) = o(1). (21) In case (b), using Lemma 5 we get (21). Therefore, there exists an index p such that ρn ≤ α and σ(n) ≥ q for n ≥ p. Let X = {x ∈ RN : |x − y| ≤ ρ and xn = yn for n < p}. Note that X ⊂ Y . If x ∈ Y and n ≥ p, then | f (xσ(n))| ≤ L . 123 Properties of Solutions of Generalized Sturm–Liouville… 3123 Assume condition (a) is satisfied. Define an operator H : Y → RN by H(x)(n) = { yn for n < p yn + ∑∞ k=n F(x)(k) ∑k i=n 1 ri for n ≥ p. If x ∈ X , then, by (3), for n ≥ p we have |H(x)(n) − yn| ≤ ∞∑ k=n |F(x)(k)| ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ k∑ i=n 1 ri ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 2L ∞∑ k=n |ak |̂rk = ρn . Therefore, HX ⊂ X . Let x ∈ X , and ε > 0. There exist an index m ≥ p and a positive constant γ such that 4L ∞∑ k=m |ak |̂rk < ε and 2γ m∑ k=1 |ak |̂rk < ε. Let C = m⋃ n=1 [yσ(n) − α, yσ(n) + α]. (22) Since C is a compact subset of R, f is uniformly continuous on C . Choose a positive δ such that if t1, t2 ∈ C and |t1 − t2| < δ, then | f (t1) − f (t2)| < γ. Choose z ∈ X such that ‖x − z‖ < δ. Then, ‖Hx − Hz‖ = sup n≥p ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∞∑ k=n (F(x)(k) − F(z)(k)) k∑ i=n 1 ri ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ ∞∑ k=p |F(x)(k) − F(z)(k)| ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ k∑ i=n 1 ri ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 2 ∞∑ k=p |ak || f (xσ(k)) − f (zσ(k))|̂rk ≤ 2γ m∑ k=1 |ak |̂rk + 4L ∞∑ k=m |ak |̂rk < 2ε. Hence, the map H : X → X is continuous with respect to the metric defined in Lemma 7. By Lemma 7, there exists a point x ∈ X such that x = Hx . Then, for n ≥ p we have 123 3124 J. Migda et al. xn = yn + ∞∑ k=n F(x)(k) k∑ i=n 1 ri . Using Lemma 2, we obtain Δ(rnΔxn) = Δ(rnΔyn) + F(x)(n) = bn + an f (xσ(n)) for n ≥ p. Hence, x is a solution of (E). Since x ∈ X and ρn = o(un), we have xn = yn + o(un). Now, assume condition (b) is satisfied. Define an operator G : Y → RN by G(x)(n) = { yn for n < p yn + ∑∞ k=n 1 rk ∑∞ i=k F(x)(i) for n ≥ p. If x ∈ X , then for n ≥ p we have |G(x)(n) − yn| ≤ ∞∑ k=n 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |F(x)(i)| ≤ L ∞∑ k=n 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |ai | = ρn . Therefore,GX ⊂ X . Let x ∈ X , and ε > 0. There exist an indexm ≥ p and a positive constant γ such that L ∞∑ k=m 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |ai | < ε and γ m∑ k=1 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |ai | < ε. Define a subset C of R by (22). Choose a positive δ such that if t1, t2 ∈ C and |t1 − t2| < δ, then | f (t1) − f (t2)| < γ . Choose z ∈ X such that ‖x − z‖ < δ. Then, ‖Gx − Gz‖ = sup n≥p ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∞∑ k=n 1 rk ∞∑ i=k (F(x)(i) − F(z)(i)) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ ∞∑ k=p 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |F(x)(i) − F(z)(i)| = ∞∑ k=p 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |ai || f (xσ(k)) − f (zσ(k))| ≤ γ m∑ k=1 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |ai | + 2L ∞∑ k=m 1 |rk | ∞∑ i=k |ai | < 3ε. Hence, the map H : X → X is continuous. By Lemma 7, there exists a point x ∈ X such that x = Hx . Then, for n ≥ p we have xn = yn + ∞∑ k=n 1 rk ∞∑ i=k F(x)(i). 123 Properties of Solutions of Generalized Sturm–Liouville… 3125 By Lemma 3, x is a solution of (E). Since x ∈ X and ρn = o(un), we have xn = yn + o(un). In our theory, two conditions (a) ∞∑ k=1 r̂k |ak | uk < ∞, (b) ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k |ai | < ∞ play a key role. Below we present a comparison of assumptions (a) and (b). Remark 2 Assume a ∈ RN, r , u : N → (0,∞), Δu ≤ 0, and ∑∞k=1 r̂k |ak |uk < ∞. Then, ∑∞ k=1 |ak | < ∞ and using Lemma 6, we obtain ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ j=k |a j | = ∞∑ k=1 1 rkuk ∞∑ j=k |a j | = ∞∑ k=1 |ak | k∑ i=1 1 ri ui ≤ ∞∑ k=1 |ak | uk k∑ i=1 1 ri < ∞. Hence, in the case r > 0 condition (b) is a consequence of condition (a). The following two examples show that, in general, conditions (a) and (b) are inde- pendent. Example 3 Assume λ ∈ (1,∞), rn = λn , un = λ−n , and an = n−3. Then, r > 0, r̂k = 1 − λ−k λ − 1 , r̂k uk = λ k − 1 λ − 1 , 1 |rk |uk = 1. Hence, ∞∑ k=1 r̂k |ak | uk = 1 λ − 1 ∞∑ k=1 λk − 1 k3 = ∞, ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ i=k |ai | = ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ i=k |ai | = ∞∑ k=1 k|ak | = ∞∑ k=1 k−2 < ∞. Therefore, in this case, condition (a) is not a consequence of (b). Example 4 Let uk = 1, rk = (−1)k , ak = 1√ k3 for any k ∈ N. Then, ∞∑ k=1 r̂k |ak | uk ≤ ∞∑ k=1 1√ k3 < ∞, ∞∑ k=1 1 |rk |uk ∞∑ j=k |a j | = ∞∑ k=1 ∞∑ j=k 1 √ j3 = ∞∑ k=1 k√ k3 =∞. Hence, in the case rk = (−1)k , condition (b) is not a consequence of (a). 123 3126 J. Migda et al. Declarations Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.
