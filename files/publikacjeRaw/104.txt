Results indicate that the major ions in the Xijiang river system are dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3 − with a higher concentration of total dissolved solids, characteristic of the drainages developed on typical carbonate regions. Obvious spatial variations of major ion concentrations are found at various spatial scales, which are dominantly controlled by the lithology particularly carbonate distribution in the region. The four selected rivers show similar seasonal variations in major ions, with lower concentrations during the rainy season. Runoff is the first important factor for controlling the weathering rate in the basin, although increasing temperature and duration of water–rock interaction could make positive contributions to the enhancement of chemical weathering. The chemical weathering rates range from 52.6 to 73.7 t/km2/yr within the lower Xijiang basin and carbonate weathering is over one order of magnitude higher than that of silicates. CO2 consumption rate by rock weathering is 2.0×1011 mol/yr, of which more than 60% is contributed by carbonate weathering. The flux of CO2 released to the atmosphere–ocean system by sulfuric acid-induced carbonate weathering is 1.1×105 mol/km2/yr, comparable with the CO2 flux consumed by silicate weathering. ophysics, Chinese Academy of 86 10 82998385; fax: +86 10 l rights reserved. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Rock weathering consumes CO2, mainly from atmospheric/soil origin, and produces aqueous HCO3 − and CO3 2−, then transport into the sea by rivers. On a geological time scale, thefluxof CO2 consumedby carbonate dissolution is balanced by the CO2 flux released to the atmosphere by carbonate precipitation in the oceans, while chemical weathering of silicate rocks acts as a net sink for atmospheric CO2. Consumption of atmospheric CO2 plays an important role in effect on the long-term global air temperature (Caldeira, 1995; Gaillardet et al., 1999; Amiotte- Suchet et al., 2003). Inversely, the atmospheric temperature determines the chemical weathering rate and the associated consumption of the atmospheric CO2. The temperature-dependence of weathering rate constitutes a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 (walker et al., 1981; Berner et al., 1983). The tendency and processes of global climate change are basically determined by the competing status of these factors. Hence, quantifying chemical weathering rates and clarifying the controlling factors are essential for understanding of Earth's climatic evolution. As weathering products of terrestrial rocks are transported mainly by rivers, riverine water chemistry is often used for evaluation of chemical weathering rates in a catchment (Meybeck, 1987; Gaillardet et al., 1999; Mortatti and Probst, 2003). Rivers integrate various processes taking place in a basin, both natural and anthropogenic. A large number of studies have demonstrated that natural factors (lithology, temperature, runoff, relief and vegetation), particularly lithologic variations are dominant controls of water chemistry for both carbonate and silicate rivers (Gaillardet et al., 1999;Horowitz et al., 1999; Grasby and Hutcheon, 2000; Millot et al., 2002). However, the relative importance of these factors remains debatable. Some studies suggest that runoff controls the chemicalweathering (Millot et al., 2002; Tipper et al., 2006), while others consider that temperature rather than runoff is more important (White and Blum, 1995; Dessert et al., 2001; Dalai et al., 2002). There are also studies emphasizing the factors such as physical erosion and water/rock contact time (Krishnaswami et al, 1999; Oliva et al., 2003; Hagedorn and Cartwright, 2009). With increasing influence of human activity, anthropogenic disturbance has beendetected fromwater geochemistry inmany rivers (Meybeck, 1998, 2003; Roy et al., 1999; Xu, 2004).

Sun et al. / Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 4749–4760 density, the Zhujiang (Pearl River) has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Themajor ion chemistry and flux of dissolvedmaterial in the Zhujiang have been generally characterized based on historic data in hydrology and water chemistry (Chen and He, 1999; Zhang et al., 2007). A number of studies focused on chemical wreathing and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) system of the Zhujiang basin (Xu and Liu, 2007; Li, et al., 2008; Gao et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009), largely addressing river geochemical signals. However, few studies paid attention to the spatial and temporal relations between these environmental factors, and the dominant factors for the chemical weathering in the basin remain to be explored. In this study, the lower Xijiang and its three major tributaries were selected for detailed investigation. These tributaries developed in various basin sizes with markedly different proportions of carbonate/ silicate in bedrock. By taking sampling simultaneously over the study area, we have a good chance to minimize the influence of the changes in runoff and temperature and focus on the effects of lithology on water chemistry. Through seasonal analysis, it allows us to identify the climatic sensitivity of the chemical weathering. This study attempts to (1) analyze seasonal and spatial patterns of major ion concentrations in the basin, (2) quantify carbonate and silicate weathering rates and the associated CO2 consumption in each subbasin, and (3) evaluate the influences of the geologic and climatic factors on the weathering rates of carbonates and silicates. 2. Study area The Zhujiang (Pearl river) is the second largest river in China in terms of annual discharge (336 km3/yr) and the largest contributor for dissolved and solid materials to South China Sea (SCS) (PRWRC, 1991). It passes entirely through an evergreen forest area in the tropical–subtropical climate zone. The mean annual temperature and precipitation are 14∼22 °C and 1200∼2200 mm, respectively. Heavy rainfalls occur mainly in the period of June to August during which water discharge accounts for 50–60% of the annual amount. The Zhujiang river system includes three principal branches, the Xijiang (West river), Beijiang (North river), and Dongjiang (East river) (Fig. 1). The Xijiang is the largest branch of the Zhujiang, accounting for 77.8% of total drainage area and 63.9% of the annual discharge of the entire Zhujiang. This study focused on the lower part of the Xijiang, where 3 major tributaries join the main channel of the Xijiang, namely Guijiang,Hejiang, and Luoding (Fig. 1). TheGuijiang andHejiang are two medium-size tributaries with a drainage area of 18,790 km2 and 11,590 km2, respectively. The Luoding is a small river with a drainage area of 3164 km2. The monthly mean temperature is 13 °C in January and 28.5 °C in July in this region. The annual precipitation is 1629 mm. Based on historical database, the annual discharge is 17.1 km3/yr in Guijiang, 8.0 km3/yr in Hejiang and 2.7 km3/yr in Luoding. The total flux of the Xijiang is up to 218.1 km3/yr. As a typical monsoon region, the atmospheric (or water) temperature and precipitation (or discharge) in the Xijiang basin vary in a synchronous pattern; all high in summer and low in winter. Carbonates are widely distributed in the Zhujiang Basin, especially in the headwater region of the Xijiang (Fig. 1) with typically developed karst landscape, and covers about 39% of the total drainage area (PRWRC, 1991). The areas covered respectively with carbonate and silicate in each subbasin were calculated based on a map for rock type distribution. In the lower Xijiang, Quaternary fluvial sediments are abundant in the lower alluvial plain and the interior river valley plain. Additional characteristics of these sub-watersheds are listed in Table 1. 3. Sampling and laboratory analysis Periodic sampling was conducted in the lower Xijiang basin, including the three major tributaries of Guijiang, Hejiang, Luoding, and theXijiang stem (13 sampling sites; Fig. 1). The sampling siteswere selected based on the spatial distributions of bedrock, vegetation, residential community location andconfluentposition of the tributaries. In each site, sampleswere taken from themiddle depth ofwater column in the channel center. For seasonal variation analysis, samples were collected in April, May (yearly-normal flux), June (flood event), July (yearly-higher flux) and December (yearly-lower flux) (Fig. 2). Temperature and pH values of the river water were measured in situ at each site. HCO3 − concentration in the water was titrated with 0.01 M HCl within 24 h after sampling. Each sample was repeated for 2 or 3 times and the analytical error is less than 5%. Samples for major ion analysis were filtered by vacuum filtration through 47-mm Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 μm pore size) and stored in two 120 ml high-density polyethylene bottles at 4 °C until analysis. Samples for cation analysis were acidified (pHb2) with concentrated HNO3. In the lab, major cations (K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+) and dissolved Si were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Major anions (Cl−, SO4 2−, NO3 −) were measured by ion chromatography. Measurement of duplicate samples indicates the analytical error less than 3%. image of Fig.�2 Fig. 3.

General characteristics of major ions pH value and major ion concentrations of the samples are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. The Xijiang river water is slightly alkaline with pH values between 6.93 and 8.19, and has a higher concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS=Ca2++Mg2++Na++K++HCO3 −+ SO4 2−+Cl−+NO3 −+SiO2) with an average of 185 mg/L. Fig. 5. Plots of (a) (Na+ K+) versus Cl−, (b) (Ca2++Mg2+) versus SO4 2−, (c) (C K+ and Na+ concentrations in the Xijiang river system range from 0.103 to 0.533 mmol/L, and should be most likely from silicate weathering because of little evaporites in the region. Ca2+ and Mg2+ commonly account for more than 60% of the total cations; about 83% (64% Ca2+) in the Xijiang stem, 79% (62% Ca2+) in the Guijiang, 74% (56% Ca2+) in Hejiang and 57% (42% Ca2+) in the Luoding. In general, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in river water can be derived from both carbonate and silicate weathering. Since carbonate has higher solubility, it produces more Ca2+ and Mg2+ than silicate under natural conditions. Therefore, a2++Mg2+) versus HCO3 − and (d) (Ca2++Mg2+) versus (HCO3 −+SO4 2−). image of Fig.�4 image of Fig.�5 4754 H. Sun et al. / Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 4749–4760 the wide distribution of carbonate in the Xijiang basin (except for the Luoding) is likely responsible for the observed higher concentrations of Ca2++Mg2+. HCO3 − is the most abundant anion in the Xijiang river system, accounting for more than 80% of the total anions, particularly in the Xijiang stem and Guijiang rivers. SO4 2− is the second dominant anion with a concentration between 0.047 and 0.310 mmol/L. Cl− ranges from 0.031–0.256 mmol/L and the highest values occur in the Luoding. NO3 − concentration varies basically between 0.011 and 0.132 mmol/L except for a value of 0.408 mmol/L (Xj-1). On average, the sum of the three anions (SO4 2−, Cl− and NO3 −) accounts for 16% of the total anions, where SO4 2− alone accounts for 7%. Fig. 6. Ion ratios of the river waters in the four subcatchments. (a) NO3 −/Na+ versus SO4 2−/Na+, and (b) Cl−/Na+ versus SO4 2−/Na+. Dissolved Silica is mainly derived from silicate weathering, which may partly be consumed by diatoms (Turner and Rabalais, 1991). The mean concentrations of dissolved silica is 0.121 mmol/L in the Xijiang stem, 0.122 mmol/L in the Guijiang, 0.120 mmlol/L in the Hejiang and 0.206 mmol/L in the Luoding. 4.2. Spatial and seasonal variations in major ion concentrations It is notable that both the pH value and Ca2++Mg2+ concentrations consistently follow an order of Guijiang≥XijiangNHejiangNLuoding, whereas K+ and Na+ show a reversed order, i.e. Guijiang≤Xi- jiangbHejiangbLuoding. Based on the rock type distribution map of the Zhujiang catchment, carbonate accounts for 42.5%, 50.8%, and 23.2% in the Xijiang, Guijiang, and Hejiang subcatchments, respectively, and little carbonate in the Luoding. This suggests a dominant impact of the bedrock weathering on the water chemistry. Both SO4 2− and Cl− concentrations are fairly higher in the Xijiang stem than in its three tributaries, indicating aprominent anthropogenic influence in theupper reaches of the Xiijang. The concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3 − in the Guijiang and Hejiang all show a decline trend from the upper to the lower, while Si concentrations show a reverse trend (Fig. 3). This pattern accords well to thedistributionof carbonate that is exposed only in theupper reaches (Fig. 1). SO4 2− concentrations in the Hejiang also decrease from upper to the lower river, consistent with the fact that intensive activities of both agriculture and industry and cities with large population all are located in the upper area of the sampling sites. SO4 2− in the Guijiang shows a similar downstream decreasing pattern, very likely attributable to the paper factories and chemical plants in the upper reaches. The four study tributaries of the Xijiang river display a similar seasonal variation pattern in major ion concentrations. The highest major ion concentration and TDS occur in December (winter), while the lowest in June (summer). InDecember, as the regional precipitation is at the lowest level of a year, the river discharge possibly comes mainly from subsurface flow, which could result in a longer time of water/rock interaction and thus greater dissolution of the solids. Samples in June were taken from the waning period of an extremely big flood event (Fig. 2), and thus have lower values of major ion concentrations due to the flood scavenging. In mid July, the discharge level is high, and the solute concentration is also fairly high, possibly due to higher temperature that could promote rapid dissolution of minerals and result in a higher soil CO2 concentration thus enhancing the solubility of the rocks. It is interesting that the dissolved Si concentration in the Xijiang stem, Guijiang and Hejiang show a reverse trend (higher in wet season than in dry season) comparedwith othermain components such as Ca2+,Mg2+ andHCO3 −. This is also reported by a previous study (Gao et al, 2009). As is explained in that study, the dissolved Si is mainly preserved in the surface siliceous soil in carbonate region and flushed out by surface water that dominates the river water during flooding season. For the Luoding, a silicate-dominated river, dissolved silicate is diluted rather than concentrated in the wet season. 5. Discussions 5.1. Sources of major ions Possible sources of major ion species in the surface water are weathering of rocks, atmospheric precipitation, evaporation–crystal- lization, and anthropogenic inputs (Gibbs, 1970). Major ion compo- sition displayed by the ternary plots (Fig. 4) suggests that carbonate rock weathering dominates the water chemistry of the Xijiang river. The relative importance of various possible sources for the major ions is stoichiometrically examined below. In Fig. 5a, the data points deviate from and scatter above the 1:1 trend line, suggesting that chloride evaporite weathering is not a significant source. This is image of Fig.�6 Fig. 7. Estimated percentage contributions (the right-side column in each subcatchment) of silicate (the upper bar) and carbonate (the lower bar) weathering to bicarbonate flux of the rivers. The left-side bar shows the percentages of silicate (the upper bar) and carbonate (the lower bar) in the bedrock. 4755H. Sun et al. / Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 4749–4760 consistent with the fact that no evaporate has been found in the river basin. Therefore, the Cl− should mainly derive from atmospheric input or residential and industrial wastes. The excess K+ and Na+ to Cl− should derive from sodium and potassium aluminosilicates weathering. Fig. 5b shows that sulfate weathering is less relevant to the Ca2+ andMg2+. In Fig. 5c, all the samples approach to the 1:1 line, demonstrating the dominant impact of carbonate and/or silicate weathering in the Xijiang river. It is possible that the slightly excess Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ (above the 1:1 line in Fig. 5c) may be attributed to sulfates, or HCO3 − decomposition by input of other acidic matter. When SO4 2− is incorporated, the samples are further closer to the 1:1 line (Fig. 5d), suggesting some influence of sulfate. Sulfate may come mainly from three sources: (1) dissolution of gypsum; (2) oxidation of pyrite in rocks and (3) anthropogenic input, such as acid rains and fertilizers. In the upper Xijiang, river water is rich in sulfate ions, ranging from 0.134 to 2.146 mmol/L (mean: 0.660 mmol/L) (Li et al., 2008). The coal-combustion industry and mining of high-sulfide coal in the Beipanjiang and Nanpanjiang catchments with severe acid rains in the upper reaches could be responsible for abundance of riverine sulfate (Han and Liu, 2004; Li et al., 2008). In the lower Xijiang, sulfate ion has been greatly diluted, ranging from 0.047 to 0.310 mmol/L (mean: 0.133 mmol/L). Sulfate, nitrate and chloride ions in river water can be mainly or partly derived from communal inputs including residential and industrial wastes, agricultural fertilizers and atmospheric input by pollution. Particularly NO3 − is most likely of anthropogenic origin. In this study, positive relationships are detected between molar ratios of NO3 −/Na+ and SO4 2−/Na+, Cl−/Na+ and SO4 2−/Na+, and Cl−/Na+ and NO3 −/Na+ (see Fig. 6), suggesting some anthropogenic origin of the Cl− and SO4 2−. Because the three anions only account for a minor part of the TDS, the anthropogenic and atmospheric influences (including rainwater input) should be rather small. 5.2. Contributions of carbonate and silicate sources to the major ions Chemical weathering of carbonate and silicate rocks with carbonic acid has been investigated by numerous studies (e.g. Berner et al., 1983; Gaillardet et al., 1999; Mortatti and Probst, 2003; Chetelat et al., 2008). CO2 is a natural acid and is the most significant reactant in rock weathering. Recently, the importance of sulfuric acid in chemical weatheringhas beenaddressed (Galy and France-Lanord, 1999; Calmels et al., 2007; Lerman et al., 2007; Xu and Liu, 2007; Li et al., 2008; Han et al., 2010). Reactions of H2SO4 with carbonate minerals may produce bicarbonate without CO2 consumption, or even release CO2 in different stoichiometric proportions. 2CaCO3 þ H2SO4 ¼ 2Ca 2þ þ 2HCO−3 þ SO 2− 4 ð1Þ CaCO3 þ H2SO4 ¼ Ca 2þ þ SO24− þ H2O þ CO2 ð2Þ Reaction (1) occurs in the case of neutralization of sulfuric acid. When a solution is in low pH level and is dominated by sulfuric acid mixing with carbonate-saturated water, for example, acid rain occurs in carbonate region, reaction (2) takes place. But this is not the typical case in the Xijiang basin (Xu and Liu, 2007; Li et al., 2008). Collectively, these processes can be largely described by the following stoichiometric equations in mmol/L. HCO3Xcarb ¼ 2CaXcarb� carb þ 2MgXcarb þ CaXcarb� sulf ð3Þ HCO3Xsil ¼ NaXsil þ KXsil þ 2CaXsil þ 2MgXsil ð4Þ The subscripts carb and sil denote for carbonate and silicate origin, respectively. HCO3_carb represents the bicarbonate from carbonate weathering and HCO3_sil from silicate weathering. Ca_carb-carb and Ca_carb-sulf denote the calcium sourced from reactions of carbonate respectively with carbonic acids and sulfuric acids. Based on Eqs. (3) and (4), it is possible to estimate the contributions of carbonate and silicate sources to themajor ions in the riverwater. For a first order estimation, we assume that: - all the chloride anion is from atmospheric salt and anthropogenic inputs; - all the sodium is derived from silicate rock weathering (Na_sil) after subtraction of chloride origin; - all potassium is derived from silicate weathering (K_sil); - calcium and magnesium are derived from carbonate (Ca_carb and Mg_carb) and silicate weathering (Ca_sil and Mg_sil); and - all SO4 2− is derived from sulfide oxidation and anthropogenic inputs. According to the lowest chloride concentration of the samples, the chloride from atmospheric input is estimated to be 0.031 mmol/L (GJ-2, collected on July 1). Then the Na+ and K+ released by silicate weathering become known. The amounts of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from carbonate and silicate dissolution can be evaluated by the ionic ratios image of Fig.�7 4756 H. Sun et al. / Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 4749–4760 Ca/Na=0.4 and Mg/Na=0.2, which were obtained by Zhang et al. (2007) fromrivers drainingvirtually a pure silicate terrain in this region. As silicate weathering in the study area is not significant in comparison with carbonateweathering, it is assumed that all SO4 2− is involved in the carbonate–H2SO4 reaction and balanced by Ca 2+ in the river water. According to Eq. (1), the amount of Ca2+ from carbonate dissolution by sulfuric acid is equivalent to 2-fold of SO4 2−. After subtraction of Ca2+ produced by silicate weathering (Ca_sil) and carbonate weathering with sulfuric acids (Ca_carb-sulf) from the measured Ca2+ for the river water, the remaining is the fraction of Ca2+ from carbonate weathering Table 2 Chemical compositions of river water in the Xijiang basin.

It is noted that Guijiang has a higher carbonate proportion but a lower carbonate-sourced HCO3 − than the Xijiang. This discrepancy could be explained by the difference in topography (see slope in Table 1). For terrains with a same area on plan maps, steeper slopes imply more exposing surface and thus more rainwater–rock interaction than flatter slopes. A greater percentage contribution of carbonate dissolution to HCO3 − has been observed in wet season (summer) than dry season (winter) in the four tributaries, indicating a possible effect of increasing temperature on acceleration of chemical weathering, as has been discussed in Section 4.2. The calculated saturation index of carbonate (SIc) (see Table 2) indicates that HCO3 − in winter is closer to saturation than in summer, thus has less potential for the increase of Fig. 8. Relationship between total dissolved solids (TDS) and discharge. Seaso concentration than in summer, leading to a higher percentage contribution in wet season (summer) than in dry season (winter). This could also explain a relatively higher percentage contribution of silicate weathering in winter than in summer (see Fig. 7). 5.3. Chemical weathering rates and associated CO2 consumption The quantities of chemical weathering for carbonate (TDS_carb) and silicate (TDS_sil) can be calculated from water chemical data (in mg/L) by the following equations: TDS Xcarb−carb ¼ CaXcarb−carb þMgXcarb þ 0:5HCO3Xcarb−carb ð5Þ TDSXcarb−sulf ¼ CaXcarb−sulf þ HCO3Xcarb−sulf ð6Þ nal concentrations of TDS for each river are averaged on spatial samples. image of Fig.�8 Fig. 9.

Seasonal runoff is calculated from the daily discharge divided by drainage basin area. 4758 H. Sun et al. / Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 4749–4760 TDSXcarb ¼ TDSXcarb−carb þ TDSXcarb−sulf ð7Þ TDSXsil ¼ CaXsil þMgXsil þ KXsil þ NaXsil þ SiO2Xsil ð8Þ Where TDS_carb-carb, TDS_carb-sulf represent the chemical weathering budget for carbonate with carbonic and sulfuric acid, respectively. HCO3_carb-carb and HCO3_carb-sulf are bicarbonate ion from carbonate weathering respectively by carbonic and sulfuric acids, and can be obtained from Eq. (3). SiO2_sil is the aqueous silica derived from silicate weathering. During silicate weathering, all HCO3 − produced is from atmospher- ic/soil CO2. For carbonate dissolution by carbonic acid, only half amount of HCO3 − is from atmospheric/soil CO2, but no HCO3 − is produced from atmospheric/soil CO2 during carbonate dissolution by sulfuric acid. Therefore, the total CO2 (RCO2) consumed by rock weathering can be calculated by the following equation: RCO2 ¼ HCO3Xsil þ 0:5HCO3Xcarb−carb ð9Þ Based on above equations, the chemical weathering rates and CO2 consumption fluxes by carbonate and silicate weathering can be estimated with water discharge and water geochemical data measured at river outlets (Table 3). The data from sampling site XJ-1 represent the entire Xijiang basin, including contributions from the Guijiang, Hejiang and Luoding. Due to small discharges of the three tributaries, thus small influence to the water geochemistry of the Xijiang stem, it could be still meaningful to compare the Xijiang at XJ-1 (where a complete daily to yearly hydrometric dataset is available) with the three tributaries. Carbonate weathering rate was calculated to be 130.9 t/km2/yr (divided by carbonate area) for Xijiang, 117.1 t/km2/yr for Guijiang, 148.6 t/km2/yr for Hejiang, and 394.9 t/km2/yr for the Luoding basins. Carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid contributes 23–32% to the total rock weathering in the river basin, which suggests a significant influence of sulfuric acid in rock chemical weathering in the study region. Silicate weathering rate is about 16.6 t/km2/yr (divided by silicate rock area) in the Xijiang, 29.0 t/km2/yr in Guijiang, 11.2 t/km2/yr in Hejiang, and 25.3 t/km2/yr in Luoding basins. These rates are compa- rable to those for Amazon (23 t/km2/yr, Mortatti and Probst, 2003), but higher than those for Nile (0.8 t/km2/yr) and Congo (4.3 t/km2/yr) basins (Gaillardet et al., 1999). The weathering rates of carbonate are 5–20 times (in t/km2/yr) higher than silicates in the Xijiang basin. On average, the total chemical (carbonate and silicates) weathering rate is about 65.2 t/km2/yr in Xijiang, 73.7 t/km2/yr in Guijiang, 52.6 t/km2/yr in Hejiang, and 62.6 t/ km2/yr in Luoding basins. In the Xijiang basin, the total annual consumption of CO2 by rock weathering is 2.0×1011 mol/yr (5.8×105 mol/km2/yr) with more than 60% by carbonate weathering. As very little carbonate in the Luoding catchment, carbonate weathering contributes a much smaller portion (22%) to the total CO2 consumption for this catchment. The area specific CO2 consumption rates by carbonate weathering in the Xijiang basin range from 8.4 to 20.5×105 mol/km2/yr (divided image of Fig.�9 4759H. Sun et al. / Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 4749–4760 by carbonate area), higher than the estimate of 8×105 mol/km2/yr for global-scaled carbonate weathering (Meybeck, 1987). The CO2 consumption through silicate weathering is 3.6–6.7×105 mol/km2/ yr (divided by silicate rock area) in the Xijiang basin, higher than that in many world rivers such as the Amazon (1.7×105 mol/km2/yr, Mortatti and Probst, 2003) and the Niger (0.3–1×105 mol/km2/yr, Picouet et al, 2002). According to previous study (Gao et al., 2009), the CO2 flux consumed by carbonate and silicate weathering within the Xijiang basin surveyed at Wuzhou (Fig. 1) are 1.7×1011 mol/yr and 0.6×1011 mol/yr, respectively, very close to the results obtained by this study (see Table 3). Carbonate weathering with sulfuric acid may lead to a net source to the atmospheric CO2, because precipitation of calcite in the ocean releases CO2 that has not been consumed on land. Based on the mean sulfate concentration in the riverwater, the fluxes of CO2 released to the atmosphere–ocean system by sulfuric acid-induced carbonate weath- ering are 3.7×1010 mol/yr or 1.1×105 mol/km2/yr for Xijiang, 1.4×109 mol/yr or 0.77×105 mol/km2/yr for Guijiang, 1.0×109 mol/yr or 0.86×105 mol/km2/yr for Hejiang and 0.21×109 mol/yr or 0.68×105 mol/km2/yr for Luoding. These fluxes are relatively lower than that for the upper Xijiang region (1.6×105 mol/km2/yr, Li et al., 2008), and are comparable with the CO2 flux consumed by silicate weathering. 5.4. Relationship between chemical weathering rates and environmental factors The major ion concentrations in the river water generally decrease exponentially with increasing discharge or runoff. In the Xijiang basin, the power of the regression fits for the TDS-discharge ranges from −0.24 to −0.08 (Fig. 8), consistent with the value of −0.4 to 0 for majority of world rivers (Walling and Webb, 1986). Compared with the change in discharge, TDS concentration varied with smaller amplitudes. This is also true during the extreme flood event occurred in the Xijiang in May 2005 (Sun et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2009), indicating that large amount of solute is provided by increased river discharge, and increasing discharge/runoff must increase chemical weathering. Among different basins, chemical weathering rates are also positively related to runoff (Fig. 9). However, the relationship between runoff and chemical weathering rates seems nonlinear; other factors such as temperature and duration of water–rock contact should be taken into account. For the Xijiang basin, the highest values of major ion concentrations are observed in December and July. For the higher concentration in July, higher temperature is possibly the major factor. As discussed in Section 4.2, higher temperatures will result in rapid dissolution and a higher soil CO2 concentration thus an increase of mineral solubility. In December, river water with the lowest temperature in a year reaches the solute saturation state (SIc) (Table 2). In the Luoding, it is found that solute concentrations in May are evidently higher than those in December with the same amount of water discharge, which should be attributed to a lower biogenic activity thus lower soil CO2 level caused by lower temperature in winter. In the Nanpanjiang and Beipanjiang basins, the upper regions of the Xijiang (Fig. 1), the total consumption flux of atmospheric CO2 by carbonate and silicate weathering are calculated as 6.9–8.7×105 mol/ km2/yr, andmore than85%by carbonateweathering (Xuand Liu, 2007). Compared with the lower Xijiang, more contribution of carbonate weathering to the CO2 consumption flux in the upper region can be explained by the higher percentage (about 60%) of carbonate area in the Nanpanjiang and Beipanjiang basins. If compared with the lower Xijiang, however, the weathering rate in these basins is under- proportionally increased with the carbonate area, for which, less precipitation (800–1200 mm/yr) and lower air temperature (10– 15 °C) might be responsible. 6. Conclusions Water geochemistry of the Xijiang stem river and its 3 tributaries is dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3 −, accounting for more than 60% of total cations and 80% of total anions. Spatial variations of major ion concentrations among the subbasins and along the river courses are consistent with the distribution of bedrock type, i.e. the ratio of carbonate versus silicate. Major ion concentrations are lower during rainy season and higher during dry season. Stoichiometric analysis and molar ratios of SO4 2−/Na+, Cl−/Na+ and NO3 −/Na+ indicate some, but minor, anthropogenic influence on the water chemistry of the Xijiang river. Chemical weathering rates range from 52.6 t/km2/yr to 73.7 t/ km2/yr within the lower Xijiang. Carbonate weathering rate is over one order higher inmagnitude than silicates. CO2 consumption rate by rock weathering is 2.0×1011 mol/yr, of which more than 60% is contributed by carbonate weathering. The flux of CO2 released to the atmosphere–ocean system by sulfuric acid-induced carbonate weath- ering is 3.7×1010 mol/yr (1.1×105 mol/km2/yr) for the Xijiang, which is comparable with the CO2 flux consumed by silicate weathering. The results show that the Xijiang basin is one of the most intensive chemical weathering regions around the world. Runoff/rainfall is the first controlling factor for the weathering rate in the basin. Increases in temperature and water–rock contact duration may significantly enhance chemical weathering rate.
