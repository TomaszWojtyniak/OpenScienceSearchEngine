Peppas*, J. Zach Hilt, Ali Khademhosseini, and Robert Langer* 1. Introduction In the last ten years there has been an explosion of ad- vances in the fields of structured and intelligent materials science and nanomaterials properties. The variety of chemical structures, together with the precise control of the molecular architecture and morphology, rationalize the numerous uses of polymers in high-technology and biological applications. For example, photodegradable polymers and photopolymeriz- able monomers are utilized as photoresists in microlithogra- phy, and polymer liquid crystals find applications in nonlinear optics. Thin polymeric films are part of electronic devices and separation membranes, while biocompatible polymers are the basis of artificial organs. Interfacial phenomena are very important in biopolymer science and engineering. The properties of these interfaces determine the applicability of various polymers. Chemical and physical interactions are essential for the development of desirable interfacial stability. Significant interest has been shown in the use of natural, synthetic, and biohybrid hydro- philic polymers as biomaterials and as carriers for drug deliv- ery. The study and understanding of the fundamental phenomena and molecular mechanisms associated with the formation of new surfaces and interfaces is therefore neces- R E V IE W Adv.

They can be used as thin films, scaffolds, or nanoparticles in a wide range of biomedical and biological applications. Here we highlight recent developments in engi- neering uncrosslinked and crosslinked hydrophilic polymers for these applications. Natural, biohybrid, and synthetic hydrophilic polymers and hydrogels are analyzed and their thermodynamic responses are dis- cussed. In addition, examples of the use of hydrogels for various thera- peutic applications are given. We show how such systems’ intelligent behavior can be used in sensors, microarrays, and imaging. Finally, we outline challenges for the future in integrating hydrogels into biomedical applications. – [*] Prof. N. A.

In addition to the over 40 000 pharma- ceutical preparations in use, it is estimated that currently there are over 8000 medical devices and 2500 diagnostic prod- ucts that employ biomaterials being used in various medical applications.[1] Despite the widespread use of materials in medicine, many biomaterials lack the desired functional prop- erties to interface with biological systems and have not been engineered for optimized performance. Therefore, there is an increasing need to develop new materials to address such problems in medicine and biology. Hydrophilic polymers, and especially their crosslinked forms, known as hydrogels, are a class of biomaterials that have demonstrated great potential for biological and medical applications. The ability to engineer traditional hydrophilic polymers with specific material properties is hampered by lack of con- trol of molecular weight, chain configuration, and polymeriza- tion kinetics. Hybrid materials have been developed to pre- serve the bulk properties of traditional polymers while making their molecular chains look more like proteins. The elusive goal of molecular recognition in synthetic polymer sys- tems has been reached in certain cases. For example, acrylic gels have been designed with recognition capabilities by incor- porating non-covalently crosslinked antibodies. These pro- teins couple the reversible-swelling character of the networks with molecular recognition by only swelling in the presence of a specific antigen. The advantage of using synthetic polymeric materials based solely on proteins or peptides is that it offers a high degree of control over properties. Peptides and pro- teins can be coded for specific properties using a basic knowl- edge of inter- and intrachain interactions. While these interac- tions are understood in other polymer systems, there is much less of an ability to control them. The present and future of biomedical materials development requires this degree of control prediction in the design, synthesis, and function of next-generation materials. Recent work with this principle in mind has resulted in protein-based materials with properties analogous to more widely used polymers, as well as new prop- erties. These new materials have been generated with a vari- able degree of efficiency and complexity. Many of these hydrophilic polymer networks have a high affinity for water but are prevented from dissolving due to their chemically or physically crosslinked network. Water can penetrate in between the polymer chains of the polymer network, subsequently causes swelling and the formation of a hydrogel.[1] Hydrogels are appealing for biological applica- tions because of their high water content and biocompatibil- ity. In the last couple of decades, hydrogels have attracted a great deal of attention, and significant progress has been made in designing, synthesizing, and using these materials for many biological and biomedical applications. Recent develop- ments include the design and synthesis of novel hydrogels and their use in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and bionano- technology. 2. Hydrogel Design, Structure, and Characterization The suitability of hydrogels as biomedical materials and their performance in a particular application depend to a large extent on their bulk structure. The most important parameters used to characterize the network structure of hy- drogels are the polymer volume fraction in the swollen state (t2,s), the molecular weight of the polymer chain between two neighboring crosslinking points (Mc), and the corresponding mesh size (n). The polymer volume fraction in the swollen state is a mea- sure of the amount of fluid imbibed and retained by the hy- drogel. The molecular weight between two consecutive cross- links, which can be either chemical or physical in nature, is a measure of the degree of crosslinking of the polymer. It is im- portant to note that due to the random nature of the polymer- ization process itself only average values of Mc can be calcu- lated. The correlation length or distance between two adjacent crosslinks, n, provides a measure of the space avail- able between the macromolecular chains (e.g., for drug diffu- sion); again, it can be reported only as an average value. These parameters, which are related to one another, can be determined theoretically or through the use of a variety of ex- perimental techniques. Two methods that are prominent among the growing number of techniques utilized to elucidate the structure of hydrogels are equilibrium-swelling theory and rubber-elasticity theory. The structure of hydrogels that do not contain ionic moi- eties can be analyzed by the Flory–Rehner theory.[1] This combination of thermodynamic and elasticity theories states that a crosslinked polymer gel that is immersed in a fluid and allowed to reach equilibrium with its surroundings is subject only to two opposing forces: the thermodynamic force of mix- ing and the retractive force of the polymer chains. At equilib- rium these two forces are equal. This physical situation is defined in terms of the Gibbs free energy: DGtotal = DGelastic + DGmixing (1) Here, DGelastic is the contribution due to the elastic retractive forces developed inside the gel, and DGmixing is the result of the spontaneous mixing of the fluid molecules with the poly- mer chains. The term DGmixing is a measure of the compatibil- ity of the polymer with the molecules of the surrounding fluid. This compatibility is usually expressed by the polymer–sol- vent interaction parameter, v1. Differentiation of Equation 1 with respect to the number of solvent molecules while keeping temperature and pressure constant results in l1 – l1,o = Dlelastic + Dlmixing (2) In Equation 2, l1 is the chemical potential of the solvent in the polymer gel and l1,o is the chemical potential of the pure R E V IE W N.

At equilibrium, the difference between the chemical potentials of the solvent outside and inside the gel must be zero. Therefore, changes in the chemical potential due to mix- ing and elastic forces must balance each other. The change of chemical potential due to mixing can be expressed using heat and the entropy of mixing. The change in chemical potential due to the elastic retrac- tive forces of the polymer chains can be determined from the theory of rubber elasticity. Upon equaling these two contribu- tions, an expression for determining the molecular weight between two adjacent crosslinks of a neutral hydrogel pre- pared in the absence of a solvent can be written as 1 Mc � 2 Mn � t V1 � � ln 1 � t2�s � � � t2�s � v1t22�s � � t 1�3 2�s � t2�s 2 � � �3� Here, Mn is the molecular weight of the polymer chains pre- pared under identical conditions but in the absence of the crosslinking agent, t is the specific volume of the polymer, and V1 is the molar volume of water. We have modified the original Flory–Rehner theory for hy- drogels prepared in the presence of water.[1] The presence of water effectively modifies the change of chemical potential due to the elastic forces. This term must now account for the volume fraction density of the chains during crosslinking. The molecular weight between crosslinks in a neutral hydrogel prepared in the presence of water is determined by 1 Mc � 2 Mn � t V1 � � ln 1 � t2�s � � � t2�s � v1t22�s � � t2�r t2�s t2�r � �1�3 � t2�s 2t2�r � � �4� Here, t2,r is the polymer volume fraction in the relaxed state, which is defined as the state of the polymer immediately after crosslinking but before swelling. The presence of ionic moieties in hydrogels makes the theo- retical treatment of swelling much more complex. In addition to the contributions of DGmixing and DGelastic in Equation 1, there is an additional contribution to the total change in Gibbs free energy due to the ionic nature of the polymer net- work, DGionic. DGtotal = DGelastic + DGmixing + DGionic (5) Upon differentiating Equation 5 with respect to the number of moles of solvent, keeping T and P constant, an expression similar to Equation 2 for the chemical potential can be de- rived as l1 – l1,o = Dlelastic + Dlmixing + Dlionic (6) Here, the Dlionic is the change in chemical potential due to the ionic character of the hydrogel. We have developed expressions for the ionic contributions to the chemical poten- tial, which exhibit strong dependencies on the ionic strength of the surrounding media and on the nature of the ions pre- sent in the solvent. Equations 7 and 8 are expressions that have been derived for swelling of anionic and cationic hydro- gels, respectively, prepared in the presence of a solvent: V1 4IMr t2�s t � �2 Ka 10�pH � Ka � �2 � ln 1 � t2�s � � � t2�s � v1t22�s � � � V1 tMc � � 1 � 2Mc Mn � � t2�r t2�s t2�r � �1�3 � t2�s 2t2�r � � �7� V1 4IMr t2�s t � �2 Kb 10pH�14 � Ka � �2 � ln 1 � t2�s � � � t2�s � v1t22�s � � � V1 tMc � � 1 � 2Mc Mn � � t2�r t2�s t2�r � �1�3 � t2�s 2t2�r � � �8� In these expressions, I is the ionic strength, Ka and Kb are the dissociation constants for the acid and base, respectively, and Mr is the molecular weight of the repeating unit. Hydrogels resemble natural rubbers in their remarkable property to elastically respond to applied stresses. A hydrogel subjected to a relatively small deformation (less than 20 %) will fully recover to its original dimension in a rapid fashion. This elastic behavior of hydrogels can be used to elucidate their structure by utilizing the rubber-elasticity theory. Here, only the form of rubber-elasticity theory used to analyze the structure of hydrogels prepared in the presence of a solvent is presented, and it is left to the reader to consult a standard ref- erence for detailed derivations.[3] s � �RT Mc 1 � 2Mc Mn � � a � 1 a2 � � t2�s t2�r � �1�3 �9� Here, s is the stress applied to the polymer sample, q is the density of the polymer, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute experimental temperature, and Mc is the desired molecular weight between crosslinks. In order to perform ana- lysis of the structure of hydrogels using rubber-elasticity theo- ry, experiments need to be performed using a tensile testing system. Interestingly, rubber-elasticity theory has been used not only to analyze chemically and physically crosslinked R E V IE W N. A.

Mater. 2006, 18, 1345–1360 hydrogels, but also hydrogels exhibiting temporary crosslinks due to hydrogen bonding. An important structural parameter for analyzing hydrogels is the space available between macromolecular chains. This space is often regarded as the molecular mesh or pores. Depending upon the size of these pores, hydrogels can be con- veniently classified as i) macroporous, ii) microporous, and iii) nonporous. A structural parameter that is often used in describing the size of the pores is the correlation length (n), which is defined as the linear distance between two adjacent crosslinks and can be calculated using n = a(r̄o 2)1/2 (10) Here, a is the elongation ratio of the polymer chains in any direction and (r̄o 2)1/2 is the root-mean-square, unperturbed, end-to-end distance of the polymer chains between two neigh- boring crosslinks. For an isotropically swollen hydrogel, the elongation ratio (a) can be related to the swollen polymer volume fraction, (t2,s) by a = t2,s –1/3 (11) The unperturbed end-to-end distance of the polymer chain between two adjacent crosslinks can be calculated using Equation 12, where Cn is the Flory characteristic ratio, L is the length of the bond along the polymer backbone (for vinyl polymers, 1.54 Å), and N is the number of links per chain that can be calculated by Equation 13. (r̄o 2)1/2 = l(CnN) 1/2 (12) N � 2Mc Mr �13� In Equation 13, Mr is the molecular weight of the repeating units of which the polymer chain is composed. Finally, when one combines Equations 10 through 13, the correlation dis- tance between two adjacent crosslinks in a swollen hydrogel can be obtained as n � t�1�32�s 2CnMc Mr � �1�2 l �14� The ability to tailor the molecular structure of hydrogels (e.g., t2,s, Mc, and n) enables the tailoring of their mechanical, responsive, and diffusive properties. As a result, hydrogels have been, and continue to be, an attractive material choice for a wide variety of biological and medical applications. In addition, the type of crosslinking can greatly modify the prop- erties of the hydrogel. The crosslinking structure of the hydro- gel can be due to a number of factors such as covalent bond- ing, entanglements, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and formation of crystallites. Covalent crosslinks can lead to stable hydrogels, while other types of crosslinks could be used to reverse the gelling properties of the hydrophilic polymers under the desired conditions. Hydrogels can be characterized based on their derivation and composition as synthetic, bio- logical, or a hybrid. In the following section, the various types of hydrogels are introduced. 2.1. Synthetic Hydrogels Polymer networks can be synthesized using various chemi- cal methods (e.g., photo- and thermal-initiated polymeriza- tion). The polymer engineer can design and synthesize poly- mer networks with molecular-scale control over structure such as crosslinking density and with tailored properties, such as biodegradation, mechanical strength, and chemical and bio- logical response to stimuli. Neutral synthetic polymers can be generated from deriva- tives of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), poly- (ethylene glycol) (PEG), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Scheme 1). PEG hydrogels are one of the most widely stud- ied and used materials for biomedical applications. PEG hydrogels are nontoxic, non-immunogenic, and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for various clinical uses. In many cases, PEG has been applied as a “stealth mate- rial” since it is inert to most biological molecules such as proteins. Some of the earliest work on the use of PEG and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as hydrophilic biomaterials was performed by Merrill et al.,[4] who showed PEO adsorption onto glass surfaces prevented protein adsorption. Since then, many forms of PEG surface modification have been used in order to render a surface protein resistant and to enhance surface biocompatibility.[5] Commonly used methods of PEG surface modification include covalent bonding through silane, acrylate, and thiol linkages, adsorption, and ionic and hydro- gen bonding, all of which have been reviewed elsewhere.[5,6] PEG polymers can be covalently crosslinked using a variety of methods to form hydrogels. A particularly appealing method of crosslinking PEG chains is through photopolymeri- zation using acrylate-terminated PEG monomers.[7] In the presence of cells, PEG hydrogels are passive constituents of the cell environment since they prevent adsorption of pro- teins. However, numerous methods of modifying PEG gels have made PEG gels a versatile template for many subse- quent conjugations. For example, peptide sequences have been incorporated into PEG gels to induce degradation[8] or modify cell adhesion (Fig. 1).[9] In addition to chemical modi- fication, block copolymers of PEG, such as triblock copoly- mers of PEO and poly(propylene oxide) (henceforth desig- nated as PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO), degradable PEO, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and other similar materials, can be used to add specific properties to the PEG hydrogels.[10] PHEMA is another hydrogel that has been extensively studied and used in biomedical applications such as contact R E V IE W N. A. Peppas et al./Hydrogels in Biology and Medicine Adv. Mater. 2006, 18, 1345–1360 © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.advmat.de 1349 lenses[11] and drug delivery.[12] The attractive features of PHE- MA include its mechanical properties, its optical transparency, and its stability in water. Like PEG, various modifications can be made to PHEMA derivatives to modify its properties. For example, dextran-modified PHEMA gels have been synthe- sized to modulate the degradation properties of the gel.[13] Also, copolymerization of HEMA monomers with other monomers, such as methyl methacrylate, can be used to modi- fy properties such as swelling and mechanical properties. Using these approaches, PHEMA and its derivatives have been used in drug-delivery and tissue-engineering applica- tions.[14] Another major synthetic polymer is PVA.[15] PVA hydro- gels are stable, and elastic gels that can be formed by the repeated freezing and thawing process or chemically cross- linked.[16] They can be formed by both physical and chemical crosslinking methods.[17] The physically crosslinked versions of PVA hydrogels are biodegradable, and thus can be used for various biomedical applications.[17–22] PVA must be cross- linked in order to be useful for a wide variety of applications, specifically in the areas of medicine and pharmaceutical sciences. Crosslinking may be achieved by chemical, irradia- tive, or physical mechanisms. PVA can be crosslinked through the use of difunctional crosslinking agents. Some of the common crosslinking agents that have been used for PVA hydrogel preparation include glutaraldehyde, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and other mono- aldehydes. When these crosslinking agents are used in the presence of sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or methanol, acetal bridges form between the pendent hydroxyl groups of the PVA chains. As with any crosslinking agent, however, residual amounts are present in the ensuing PVA gel. It becomes ex- tremely undesirable to perform the time-consuming extrac- tion procedures in order to remove this residue. If the residue is not removed, the gel is unacceptable for biomedical or pharmaceutical applications because, if it were placed directly in the body, the release of this toxic residue would have ob- vious undesirable effects. Other methods of chemical cross- linking include the use of electron-beam or gamma irradia- tion. These methods have advantages over the use of chemical crosslinking agents as they do not leave behind toxic, elutable agents. In addition, photocrosslinkable PVA hydrogels have been synthesized that facilitate cell adhesion in tissue-engi- neering applications.[23,24] 2.1.1. Responsive Hydrogel Systems By tailoring their molecular structure, polymer networks can be created that interact with their environment in a pre- programmed and intelligent manner. Environmentally responsive hydrogels have been synthesized that are capable of sensing and responding to changes to external stimuli, such as changes to pH, pI, and temperature.[25] Recent reviews have highlighted the extensive research focused on the devel- opment and application of new environmentally sensitive hydrogels, especially those sensitive to temperature, pH, and specific analytes.[3,26–28] The response mechanism is based on the chemical structure of the polymer network (e.g., the functionality of chain side groups, branches, and crosslinks). For example, in networks that contain weakly acidic or basic pendent groups, water sorp- tion can result in ionization of these pendent groups depending on the solution pH and ionic composition. The gels then act as semipermeable membranes for the counterions, thereby influ- encing the osmotic balance between the hydrogel and the ex- ternal solution through ion exchange, depending on the ion– ion interactions. For ionic gels containing weakly acidic pen- dent groups, the equilibrium degree of swelling increases as the pH of the external solution increases, while the degree of swell- ing increases as the pH decreases for gels containing weakly basic pendent groups. Numerous properties (e.g., ionic content, ionization equilibrium considerations, nature of counterions, and nature of the polymer) contribute to the swelling of ionic hydrogels, and these have been extensively studied.[29–31] Examples of some commonly studied ionic polymers include poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), polyacrylamide (PAAm), poly(diethylaminoethyl methacrylate), and poly(di- methylaminoethyl methacrylate) (Scheme 1). Temperature-responsive hydrogels are one of the most widely studied responsive hydrogel systems. These systems, which are mostly based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and its derivatives, undergo a reversible volume- phase transition with a change in the temperature of the envi- R E V IE W N.

Reproduced from [9]. ronmental conditions. This type of behavior is related to poly- mer phase separation as the temperature is raised to a critical value known as the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Networks showing a lower critical miscibility temper- ature tend to shrink or collapse as the temperature is increased above the LCST, and the gels swell upon lowering the temperature below the LCST. For example, PNIPAAm exhibits a LCST around 33 °C. PNIPAAm and other thermo- sensitive hydrogels have been studied for variety of applica- tions, including drug delivery and tissue engineering.[27,32] 2.1.2. Imprinted Hydrogels In many applications, it is desirable to control the molecular- recognition properties of hydrogels for various biological ana- lytes and physiological processes. The design and synthesis of such molecular-recognition schemes requires techniques in which the chemical functionality and structure can be orga- nized in a precise 3D configuration. Polymer networks exhibit- ing these desired characteristics can be prepared using tem- plate-mediated polymerization techniques (e.g., molecular imprinting), resulting in recognition domains that can specifi- cally bind template molecules with high affinity.[33] Although the field of molecular imprinting is more than three decades old, only recently have researchers applied these techniques to hydrogel systems, to biologically significant target molecules, and to the creation of controlled drug-delivery systems.[34–37] This field of research shows great promise and could be used to synthesize synthetic gels that recognize particular analytes. 2.2. Biological Hydrogels In general, hydrogels from natural sources can be derived from polymers such as collagen, hyaluronic acid (HA), fibrin, alginate, agarose, and chitosan.[38] Depending on their origin and composition, various natural polymers have specific utili- ties and properties. Many natural polymers, such as collagen, hyaluronic acid, and fibrin, are derived from various compo- nents of the mammalian extracellular matrix. Collagen is the main protein of the mammalian extracellular matrix, while HA is a polysaccharide that is found in nearly all animal tissues. Alternatively, alginate and agarose are polysaccharides that are derived from marine algae sources. The advantages of natural polymers include low toxicity and biocompatibility. Collagen and other mammalian-derived protein-based poly- mers are effective matrices for cellular growth because they contain many cell-signaling domains present in the in vivo extracellular matrix. Collagen gels can be created through natural means without chemical modifications. However, in many cases these gels are mechanically weak. To synthesize gels with enhanced mechanical properties, various methods have been developed such as chemical crosslinking,[39,40] cross- linking with UV or temperature,[39,41] or mixing with other polymeric agents.[39,42] Collagen degradation is mediated through natural means by proteins such as collagenase. HA is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is composed of repeating disaccharide units and is particular prevalent during wound healing and in joints. Covalently crosslinked HA hydrogels can be formed by means of multiple chemical modi- fications.[43–46] HA is degraded by cells through the release of enzymes such as hyaluronidase. Alginate is a linear polysaccharide that is derived from brown seaweed and bacteria. It gels under benign conditions, which makes it attractive for cell encapsulation. Alginate gels are formed upon formation of ionic bridges between divalent cations (i.e., Ca2+) and various polymer chains of the alginate. The crosslinking density of alginate gels is a function of the monomer units and molecular weight of the polymer. Algi- nate gels degrade slowly in a process in which the mechanical properties of the gels are altered with time. R E V IE W N. A. Peppas et al./Hydrogels in Biology and Medicine Adv.

Dissolved chitosan can be cross- linked by increasing pH, by dissolving in a nonsolvent[47] or by photocrosslinking.[48] Chitosan can be degraded by the lyso- some and is therefore degraded in humans.[49] Chitosan gels can be used for many applications, including drug deliv- ery.[50,51] 2.3. Biohybrid Hydrogels By integrating biological entities with synthetic hydrogels, novel systems can be created that synergistically combine well-evolved biological mechanisms, such as high affinity and specificity of binding, with tailorable hydrogel properties (e.g., mechanical stability and environmental-responsive prop- erties). For example, biologically active molecules can be incorporated into polymer networks (e.g., by physical or chemical entrapment) to produce conjugated biomaterials.[52] Research groups have immobilized enzymes within the net- work structure of hydrogels. For instance, activated glucose oxidase has been incorporated into pH-sensitive cationic hydrogels.[53] The glucose oxidase converts glucose into gluco- nic acid, thereby lowering the pH of the local environment, which then causes the hydrogel network to swell in the case of a cationic gel. In other work, stimuli-responsive hybrid materials consist- ing of hydrogels and genetically engineered proteins have been demonstrated (Fig. 2).[54] The stimuli-responsive hydro- gel exhibited gating and controlled transport of biomolecules across the network, demonstrating its potential for microflui- dics and drug delivery. Hydrogels have been synthesized so that they contain func- tional groups for enhancing cellular adhesion.[9,55] In this scheme, the addition of such modalities can dramatically change the properties of the hydrogels. The most common peptides used to modify hydrogels are amino acid sequences derived from natural proteins, such as RGD (derived from proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, or collagen), IKVAV, and YIGSR from laminin. Using these approaches, PEG[9,55,56] and other hydrogels, such as alginate,[57] have been modified with RGD to enhance cellular adhesion (Fig. 1). Also, PVA gels have been modified to enhance cellular adhe- sion by incorporation of GHK[58] or RGDS[59] sequences for adhesion of hepatocytes and epithelial cells, respectively. In addition, the degradation property of hydrogels may be modified through incorporation of degradable linkers. Many synthetic gels have been modified in various ways to change their properties. For example, Hubbell, Anseth, West, and others have synthesized degradable PEG hydrogels based on a number of schemes, such as synthesis of block copolymers with degradable blocks[10,60,61] and the incorporation of pro- teases.[8] Furthermore, other hydrogels have also been linked with degradable units to render them degradable. For exam- ple, dextran has been incorporated into PHEMA gels to form enzymatically degradable gels.[13] R E V IE W N. A.

Growth factors can be covalently attached to the hydrogels. For example, transform- ing growth factor beta (TGF-b) has been tethered to PEG to regulate smooth muscle cell function;[62] in addition, other TGF-b related proteins such as bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) have been covalently attached to alginate to regu- late osteoblast migration and calcification into the gels.[63] Natural monomers such as peptides have also been used to synthesize hydrogels. For example, genetic-engineering approaches to synthesize peptides have also been used to fab- ricate hydrogels made from artificial peptides and artificial proteins.[64–67] Polypeptides designed using genetic engineer- ing have many advantages over synthetic peptides, including its ease of synthesis using established protocols. Polypeptides have been used to synthesize silklike structures with pH-sensi- tive variations that incorporate GA modalities.[65] Other poly- peptide variations include elastin-based materials.[68] In addi- tion, Zhang has developed a series of hydrogels made from self-assembling peptides.[64] The self-assembly can be con- trolled by microenvironmental features such as pH that allow the gels to be formed in situ as required. Although current ap- proaches to synthesize these gels are expensive, it is antici- pated that new processes to enhance such techniques will be valuable in making these gels more economically feasible. 3. Hydrogels in Therapeutics Hydrogels have been applied as fundamental components in a variety of therapeutic applications. In the following, we briefly highlight examples in tissue engineering and controlled drug delivery. For example, attention has recently been given to the use of micro- and nanofabrication approaches to deliv- er drugs and to fabricate vascularized tissue-engineering scaf- folds. Naturally, because of their biocompatibility, compatibil- ity with microscale fabrication approaches, and their responsiveness to their environment, hydrogels and hydro- philic polymers are becoming important for materials for constructing these devices. 3.1. Tissue Engineering Tissue engineering aims to replace, repair, or regenerate tis- sue or organ function and to create artificial tissues and organs for transplantation.[69] Scaffolds used in tissue engi- neering mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and provide support for cell adhesion, migration, and prolifera- tion. They also allow for differentiated function, new tissue generation, and its 3D organization. Of course, scaffolds need to be completely biodegradable so that after tissue is grown, the resulting structures are made entirely from biological components. Cell-laden hydrogels are interesting scaffolding materials. Their high water content, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties that resemble natural tissues make hydrogels particularly attractive for tissue-engineering applications. By adding cells to a hydrogel before the gelling process, cells can be distributed homogeneously throughout the re- sulting scaffold. Cells have been encapsulated in both natur- al hydrogels, such as collagen and fibrin materials, as well as in synthetic hydrogels made from PEG. Also, combina- tions of natural and artificial polymers can be used to pro- vide proper scaffold degradation behavior after implanta- tion. Fibroblasts, osteoblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and chondrocytes successfully immobilize and attach to these hydrogel scaffolds. With a combination of microfluidic channel technology and photopatterning of hydrogels, these scaffolds can facilitate increased growth-factor delivery and shape sculpting that is only limited by its molded hous- ing.[70] Hydrogels have been used as scaffolds for tissue engineer- ing[38,57] and as immunoisolation barriers for microencapsula- tion technology (Fig. 3).[71–73] In microencapsulation, allo- geneic or xenogeneic cells are protected from the host’s immune system through separation from the immune compo- nents using a semipermeable membrane (Fig. 3A). Lim and Sun demonstrated the use of alginate-based polymers that were crosslinked using calcium ions for the treatment of dia- betic animals.[73] In addition to calcium alginate based micro- capsules, the use of PEG coatings as a method of coating cells has also been shown.[74] Additionally, polymeric microcap- sules containing cells can be immobilized in hydrogels such as agarose gels to enhance the functionality of transplanted con- structs.[71] In tissue-engineering scaffolds, hydrogels can be used to deliver signals to the cells, act as support structures for cell growth and function, and provide space filling (Fig. 3B).[38,57,75,76] Desired characteristics of hydrogel scaf- folds include physical parameters such as mechanical strength and degradability, while biological properties include biocom- patibility and the ability to provide a biologically relevant microenvironment.

Hydrogels and tissue engineering. Schematic diagram of the use of hydrogels in microencapsulation (A) and as a tissue-engineering scaffold (B). Natural hydrogels, such as collagen, were some of the first materials used in tissue engineering. Collagen has been used for tissue engineering of various organs such as liver,[77] skin,[78] and blood vessels.[79] Natural materials such as hya- luronic acid hydrogels can be crosslinked to form degradable hydrogels.[45,80] Natural materials have also been used in con- junction with poly(L-glutamic acid) (lactic-co-glycolic acid) tissue-engineering scaffolds to provide more support for cell growth. For example, fibrin-filled PLGA scaffolds have been used to modulate tissue invasion in vivo for bone regenera- tion.[81] Also, natural materials such as alginate have been modified with RGD peptides to modify osteoblast adhesion in bone-tissue engineering.[57] Hubbell and co-workers have modified specific groups in fibrin such as factor XIIIa so that the properties of this natural hydrogel, such as degradability, can be controlled.[82] In addition to natural hydrogels, synthetic hydrogels have also been widely used in various tissue-engineering applica- tions. PEG is the most commonly used synthetic polymer for tissue engineering. PEG gels are inherently cell repellent; however, with chemical modification it is possible to incorpo- rate various peptides or other signaling molecules into the gels that reduce their cell-repulsion behavior.[83] Recently, photopolymerizable hydrogels[9,84] have been used for many tissue-engineering applications, including growth of bone,[56,85,86] cartilage,[87–89] vascular tissues,[90] and other tissues.[9] Photocrosslinking allows the polymers to be gelled in situ, enabling the polymer to conform to the shape of the implantation site. In addition, cells within photocross- linked hydrogels are uniformly distributed.[91] Various param- eters of these polymers can be controlled to modify cell behavior. For example, UV exposure, photoinitiator concen- tration, monomer chain length, and conjugation of various biological molecules can be used to modify gel properties. 3.2. Controlled Drug Delivery Hydrogels have been widely applied as intelligent carriers in controlled drug-delivery systems.[3,26,92,93] Researchers have engineered their physical and chemical properties at the mo- lecular level to optimize their properties, such as permeability (e.g., sustained-release applications), enviro-responsive nature (e.g., pulsatile-release applications), surface functionality (e.g., PEG coatings for stealth release), biodegradability (e.g., bioresorbable applications), and surface biorecognition sites (e.g., targeted release and bioadhesion applications), for con- trolled drug-delivery applications (Fig. 4). Control of hydrogel swelling properties can be used as a method to trigger drug release.[94] One example of how the change in the swelling properties of hydrogels can be used in drug delivery is a PVA and PEG system.[95] By controlling the polymer chain length, polymer composition, and initiation concentration and other factors, it is possible to control the density and degree of network crosslinking. Environmentally responsive hydrogels have been applied in a wide variety of controlled drug-delivery applications. The intelligent response of these systems allows for release that is controlled by the conditions of the environment. Tempera- ture-responsive hydrogels (e.g., PNIPAAm, which is the most widely studied) have been widely used to create drug-delivery systems that exhibit a pulsatile release in response to temper- ature changes.[27,32] In addition, pH-responsive hydrogels have been applied in numerous controlled-release applications. For example, pH-responsive hydrogels composed of PEG-con- taining ionic networks have been applied for the oral delivery of proteins such as insulin[96,97] and calcitonin.[98,99] By incorporating enzymes within environmentally respon- sive hydrogels, researchers have created drug-delivery systems that are responsive to biological analytes. For example, an important class of polymers for drug delivery are glucose-re- sponsive hydrogels that are based on polymers incorporating glucose oxidase within their network.[53,100,101] These polymers exhibit release kinetics that could be useful as “smart” materi- als for diabetes applications in which the materials can sense changes in glucose concentration and release insulin in response. Another area of drug delivery where hydrogels have proven beneficial is in systems where molecular recognition is utilized for enhanced residence times, sustained delivery, and/or tar- geted drug delivery. Over the last twenty years,[102] bioadhe- R E V IE W N. A. Peppas et al./Hydrogels in Biology and Medicine 1354 www.advmat.de © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Adv. Mater. 2006, 18, 1345–1360 Figure 4. Various delivery and release mechanisms of hydrogels. sion has been the focus of extensive research. In particular, bioadhesive and mucoadhesive systems have been the focus of research where enhanced residence times will lead to improved drug delivery and activity.[103] In recent years, bio- mimetic systems that mimic biological recognition processes have proven valuable in drug-delivery applications, and these systems have shown great potential for enhanced drug-deliv- ery systems.[36,37] 4. Hydrogels in Diagnostic Devices Hydrogels can also be used as integral components in mi- crodevices. This is because hydrogels can be incorporated within microdevices using photolithographic, molding, or other approaches. The ability to easily integrate hydrogels is particularly appealing given the breadth of smart hydrogels that have been developed. Environmentally responsive hydro- gels have been used as functional components of micro- devices, including as biosensors and valves. pH-sensitive photocrosslinkable PEG-based hydrogels have been shown to function as functional valves within microfluidic channels by sensing the pH of the solution and in response changing their swelling, which results in actuation.[104] Other methods of actuating valves using smart materials are now being investi- gated, such as the use of photoactive (Fig. 5), temperature- dependent, or electrically and chemically sensitive polymers that change their properties using controlled external stimuli. PEG hydrogels have also been used within microchannels to fabricate structures capable of adding functional capability. The integration of PEG hydrogels within microfluidic chan- nels has been shown to control the location of proteins and cells within a microfluidic channel for controlled microreac- tors.[105,106] In addition, PEG hydrogels can be used to form microstructures within channels capable of capturing and localizing cells in regions of low shear stress (Fig. 6).[107] The ability to capture cells from flowing solutions can be used for many applications such as sensing, cell separation, and cell- based microreactors. Microchannels can also be used to synthesize hydrogels with unique properties. One recently illustrated example is in controlling the spatial properties of materials. Controlling the spatial properties of materials could be potentially useful for a variety of applications such as tissue engineering and drug delivery.[108] Previously, synthesis of gels with spatially distinct properties required cumbersome methods such as generating gradients of ligands within hydrogels and then using photo- reactive domains to covalently anchor the ligands to the gel. For example, by using lasers, specific regions within an aga- rose gel could be tethered with RGD peptide, which allowed for neurite extension within peptide-modified regions.[109] Recently, microfluidic systems have been used to control the spatial properties of materials.

Images in the right panel indicate how the flow within the channels can be altered by swelling of the hydrogels. Reproduced from [70]. fluidic channel, it is possible to fabricate gels with control over their spatial properties (Fig. 7).[55] Gels can be synthesized with gradients of signaling or adhesive molecules or with vary- ing crosslinking density across the material. Such gels can be used to release drugs in a spatially dependent manner, to induce directed cell migration or adhesion within the gel, or to study biological systems.[55,110] It is anticipated that the ability to enclose biological detec- tion molecules, such as antibodies within hydrogels can be used to enhance biological signals from these analysis since a higher number of targeting molecules can be immobilized within a particular region of a channel.[105] The increase in the density of the desired targeting receptor in the device in- creases its sensitivity in comparison to direct immobilization of the antibody on a surface. 4.1. Medical and Biological Sensors In addition to pumps and valves, hydrogels can be used as integrated sensors within microdevices. Recently, microelec- tromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor platforms, specifically those based on microcantilevers, have been applied in a wide variety of applications due their miniature size and ultrahigh sensitivity. For example, environmentally responsive hydro- gels have been micropatterned onto silicon microcantilevers to develop an ultrasensitive bioMEMS sensor platform (Fig. 8).[111,112] This was the first demonstration of a micro- scale MEMS sensor device where actuation is controlled by an intelligent polymer network. In similar work, Thundat and co-workers[113] have recently demonstrated a variation on this novel sensor platform by integrating hydrogels responsive to CrO4 2– with commercial silicon microcantilevers to create CrO4 2– sensors. More recently, another variation has been demonstrated where hydrogels containing benzo-18-crown-6 coated on microcantilevers were used to create Pb2+ sen- sors.[114] In other work utilizing the actuation response of hydrogels, Grimes and co-workers[115,116] demonstrated wireless pH sen- sors based on integrating pH-responsive hydrogels with mag- netoelastic thick films. The sensor device functioned by remo- tely monitoring the change in resonance frequency resulting from an applied mass load of the magnetoelastic sensor de- vice. Recently, Han et al.[117] demonstrated a constant-volume hydrogel osmometer as a novel sensor platform. The concept was illustrated with a device where a pH-responsive hydrogel was confined between a rigid semipermeable membrane and the diaphragm of a miniature pressure sensor. Changes in the osmotic swelling pressure of the hydrogel resulting from changes in pH were accurately measured via the pressure sen- sor. Although the device had macroscale dimensions, the design could be easily miniaturized for microscale sensor development. Other groups have demonstrated macroscale sensor platforms for pH[118] and CO2 [119] using pressure sen- sors to transduce the swelling response of hydrogel systems. These systems also have the ability to be miniaturized, which would greatly enhance their applicability. Several research groups have patterned hydrogels contain- ing immobilized oxidoreductase enzymes, such as glucose oxi- dase, lactate oxidase, and alcohol oxidase, onto electrodes using photolithography to create biosensors for monitoring various analyte levels.[120–125] In other work, Sheppard and co- R E V IE W N.

In related work, Guiseppi-Elie and co- workers[128] demonstrated chemical and biological sensors that applied conducting electroactive hydrogel composites as recognition elements and utilized electrochemical detection. 4.2. Microarrays Control of surface properties and spatial location of hydro- philic polymers is of great importance for a variety of applica- tions ranging from high-throughput systems to cell biology studies. Hydrogels and hydrophilic polymers have been used for patterning surfaces, immobilizing cells and protein within hydrogel microstructures, and controlling cell–cell interac- tions in hydrogels. Various methods of grafting PEG to the substrate have been used based on the surface properties of the substrates. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of PEG- terminated alkanethiol molecules have been used extensively to form dense layers of PEG on surfaces.[129,130] More recently, various modification schemes have been used to form stable biofouling-resistant surfaces. For example, immobilizing poly(L-lysine) to PEG has been used to form PEGylated layers on metal surfaces.[131,132] With the advent of surface-patterning approaches such as microcontact printing and photolithography, PEG has been routinely used to pattern surfaces. In most schemes, PEG-ter- minated SAMs are used to resist surface adhesion.[133–136] Be- cause of the thiol linkage, these monolayers have typically been limited to gold substrates. This has resulted in research into other types of PEG-based polymers for surface modifica- tions. For example, PEG has been grafted to poly(L-lysine) to facilitate immobilization of PEG molecules on metal oxide surfaces.[131,132] Other modification approaches, such as silane and acrylate chemistries, have been used to anchor PEG on surfaces for patterning cells and proteins. More recently, we have synthesized PEG-based molecules that can form multivalent anchorage sites on various sub- strates such as glass and oxides.[137] These molecules were shown to form stable layers on surfaces of various substrates based on silane chemistry. In addition, we demonstrated the use of these polymers for patterning surfaces and fabricating nanostructures.[138] Photocrosslinkable PEG hydrogels have been used to immobilize cells in particular regions of a sub- strate. This has been done by either patterning PEG on a sub- strate[138–141] or by directly capturing cells within the PEG.[142,143] Also, collagen gels have been molded to pattern cells.[144] Controlling the degree of cell–cell contact is an important area of microscale cell control that could have applications in cell-based screening and drug-delivery applications. Some of the pioneering work using micropatterns to control cell–cell contact was performed by Toner and co-workers.[145–147] Nat- ural hydrophilic polymers such as polysaccharides have also been used as patterning materials. We have shown that hydro- philic polysaccharides such as HA can form adsorbed mono- layers on surfaces of hydrophilic substrates.[148–150] In addition, the use of layer-by-layer deposition of hydrophilic polymers (i.e., HA and poly(L-lysine)) can also be used to generate pat- terned co-cultures.[149] Temperature-responsive polymers such as PNIPAAm are also useful for patterning cells.[151–154] Yamato et al. have reported the use of PNIPAAm-patterned polystyrene sub- R E V IE W N.

Cells are allowed to adhere only to the PNIPAAm-lacking polystyrene areas below the LCST. After the culture temperature is increased over the LCST, the second cell type is allowed to attach to the PNIPAAm-grafted areas. 4.3. Diagnostic Imaging In medical imaging, delivering the correct dose of imaging agent and targeting the delivery to the correct location are critical for successful diagnosis. Therefore, the same proper- ties that make hydrogels attractive carriers for therapeutics in controlled drug-delivery applications can be applied for deliv- ery and targeting in controlled imaging applications. In partic- ular, hydrogels can be applied as carriers with tailored release properties, as coatings with targeting capabilities, as coatings with stealth properties, or as combinations of these. Only recently have researchers begun to apply hydrogel sys- tems in imaging applications. For example, a novel carrier for quantum dots based on nanogels was demonstrated for intra- cellular imaging (Fig. 9).[155] In other work, hydrogel micro- spheres were applied to confine water-soluble semiconductor nanocrystals.[156] These hybrid hydrogels systems could be applied as fluorescent probes in biological-imaging applica- tions. In other research, hydrogels have been applied as car- riers for the delivery of radiochemotherapy agents.[157] Addi- tionally, hydrogel coatings have been applied to encapsulate radioisotopes for radiation-delivery devices.[158] 5. The Future: Hydrogels and Bionanotechnology The design and synthesis of “smart” hydrophilic polymers and hydrogels has significant potential in future biomedical and nanotechnology applications. The future success of these materials relies on the development of novel materials that can address specific biological and medical challenges. This development will occur through synthesis of new polymers or by modifying natural polymers. For tissue engineering, the desired tissue should be used as the model to engineer the desired chemical, mechanical, and biological properties into the hydrogel. Hydrogels being used for cartilage or tissue engineering should be capable of providing mechanical prop- erties and loading as well as the molecular signals that are present in the native or regenerating organ. In addition, other properties of gels, such as pore sizes and degradation proper- ties, must also be optimized. Novel tissue-engineering approaches should incorporate temporal and spatial signals that are present during the normal healing process. With respect to drug delivery, the continued development of “smart” biocompatible materials that can respond to their environments will provide new and improved methods of delivering molecules for therapeutic applications. Finally, ad- vancing the knowledge and the use of hydrogels and smart polymers for nanotechnology is an important area with signifi- cant potential that remains to be fully investigated. The incor- poration of functional hydrogels into microdevices and the use of microdevices to engineer hydrogels will continue to provide new methods for fabricating improved hydrogel- based systems. The above examples represent some of the approaches that can be used to synthesize and use hydrophilic polymers and hydrogels for biological and medical problems. With the development of new materials and novel methods of engineer- ing chemical, mechanical, and biological functionality into hydrophilic molecules, we anticipate that in the future hydro- philic polymers will play an even greater role in biomedical applications and nanotechnology.
