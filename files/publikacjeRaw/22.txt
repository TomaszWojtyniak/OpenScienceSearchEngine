M(X , Y ) may be regarded as a generalized Köthe dual space (cf. [3,17]) and a basic question is to identify M(X , Y ) for a given spaces X and Y . Many authors have investigated this problem forOrlicz spaces andmany characterizations (mainly partial) have been given—see for example Shragin [23], Ando [1], O’Neil [22], Zabreiko– Rutickii [24], Maurey [18], Maligranda–Persson [17] and Maligranda–Nakai [16]. In 2000 Djakov and Ramanujan settled the problem for Orlicz sequence spaces and, recently, in [13] the authors established an analogous characterization for Orlicz func- B Jakub Tomaszewski jakub.tomaszewski@put.poznan.pl Karol Leśnik klesnik@vp.pl 1 Institute of Mathematics, Poznań University of Technology, ul.

In both cases, the space of pointwise multipliers M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) between Orlicz spaces is proved to be just another Orlicz space, i.e. M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) = Lϕ�ϕ1, (1.1) where the function ϕ � ϕ1 is generalized Young conjugate (generalized Legendre transform) of ϕ1 with respect toϕ. Observe that the above characterization generalizes, in the evident way, the classical Köthe duality formula for Orlicz spaces, this is (Lϕ1)′ = M(Lϕ1, L1) = Lϕ∗1 , (1.2) where ϕ∗1 is the Young conjugate of ϕ1 (i.e. ϕ ∗ 1 = id � ϕ1). Let us also mention here, that the identification as in (1.1) seems to be the most desirable, since the function ϕ � ϕ1 is given in an explicit and constructive way, in contrast to theorems from [16] and [11], which have rather existential character (cf. [1,18,22–24]). In the paper we focus on the multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces. Such inves- tigations have been already initiated by Nakai [20] (cf. [21]). Under a number of assumptions on functions ϕ, ϕ1 he generalized results of [16] to the Musielak–Orlicz setting. Since this method is not constructive (see discussion in [13]), we are not going to employ it. Instead of that we will use ideas of [5] and [13] to prove that the represen- tation (1.1) holds also in the Musielak–Orlicz case, for an arbitrary σ—finite measure space and without any additional assumptions on Musielak–Orlicz functions ϕ, ϕ1. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we give necessary definitions on Banach ideal space and Musielak–Orlicz spaces. We also define the function ϕ � ϕ1 (Young conjugate of ϕ1 with respect to ϕ) for Musieak–Orlicz functions ϕ, ϕ1. The next section contains a number of technical lemmas concerning Musielak– Orlicz spaces and multipliers. Consequently, we are ready to prove the representation theorem in the third section. Finally, the last section is devoted to discussion on fac- torization and differences between Orlicz and Musielak–Orlicz cases. In particular, we give an example showing that inequality ϕ−11 (ϕ � ϕ1)−1 � ϕ−1 is not necessary condition for factorization of Musielak–Orlicz spaces, unlike in the Orlicz spaces case (cf. [13, Theorem 2]). 2 Notation and preliminaries Trough the paper wewill assume that (�,�,μ) is a σ -finite, complete measure space. For a given set A ∈ � we will denote the non-atomic part and purely atomic part of A by Ac and Aa , respectively. Notice, that there may be at most countably many atoms in �, since the measure space is σ -finite. To simplify the notion, we will assume that all atoms in �, if there are any, are singletons. Let L0 = L0(�,�,μ) be the space of classes of equivalence of μ-measurable, real valuable andμ-a.e. finite functions. A Banach space X ⊂ L0 is called the Banach ideal space if it satisfies the ideal property, i.e. x ∈ L0, y ∈ X and |x | ≤ |y| implies x ∈ X and ‖x‖X ≤ ‖y‖X (|x | ≤ |y| means that |x(t)| ≤ |y(t)| for μ-a.e. t ∈ �). 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 491 For x ∈ L0 we define its support as supp(x) := {t ∈ � : x(t) = 0}. A support suppX of a Banach ideal space X is defined as a measurable subset of � such that: (i) for each x ∈ X there is A ∈ � with μ(A) = 0 such that supp(x) ⊂ suppX ∪ A, (ii) there is x ∈ X such that μ(suppX − supp(x)) = 0. Notice that according to the above definition suppX is not unique, thus we rather write a support, than the support of X . For any measurable F ⊂ � and a Banach ideal space X we define X [F] := {x ∈ X : μ(supp(x)\F) = 0} with the norm ‖x‖X [F] = ‖xχF‖X . Given a Banach ideal space X on � and a positive measurable weight function v, the weighted space X(v) is defined as X(v) := {x ∈ L0 : xv ∈ X} with the norm ‖x‖X(v) = ‖xv‖X . Writing X = Y for two Banach ideal spaces X , Y we mean that they are equal as set, but norms are just equivalent. Recall also that for Banach ideal spaces X , Y the inclusion X ⊂ Y is always continuous, i.e. there is c > 0 such that ‖x‖Y ≤ c ‖x‖X for each x ∈ X . A Banach ideal space X satisfies the Fatou property (X ∈ (F P) for short) if for each sequence (xn) ⊂ X satisfying xn ↑ x μ-a.e. and supn ‖xn‖X < ∞, there holds x ∈ X and ‖x‖X ≤ supn ‖xn‖X . Given two Banach ideal spaces X , Y over the same measure space (�,�,μ) we define their pointwise product space X � Y = {x · y ∈ L0 : x ∈ X , y ∈ Y }, with a quasi–norm ‖z‖X�Y = inf{‖x‖X ‖y‖Y : z = xy}. If additionally suppX = �, then the space of pointwise multipliers from X to Y is defined as M(X , Y ) = {y ∈ L0 : xy ∈ Y for all x ∈ X}, with the natural operator norm ‖y‖M = sup ‖x‖X ≤1 ‖xy‖Y . When there is no risk of confusion we will just write ‖ · ‖M for the norm of M(X , Y ). If Banach ideal spaces X and Y have the Fatou property then both spaces M(X , Y ) and X � Y have the Fatou property [11,12,17]. We will need the following easy observation concerning the space of pointwise multipliers. Let A, B ⊂ � be measurable sets such that A ∪ B = �. Given a Banach ideal space X over �, we can decompose it as X = X [A] ⊕ X [B], 123 492 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski with the (equivalent) norm given by ‖x‖X [A]⊕X [B] = ‖xχA‖X [A] + ‖xχB‖X [B]. It is easy to see that the space of pointwise multipliers respects such a “decomposition”, i.e. M(X , Y ) may be written as follows M(X , Y ) = M(X [A]⊕ X [B], Y [A]⊕ Y [B]) = M(X [A], Y [A])⊕ M(X [B], Y [B]). (2.1) In another words, determining the space of pointwise multipliers between two Banach ideal spaces, we may determine it on A and on B separately. A function ϕ : [0,∞) → [0,∞] will be called the Young function if it satisfies ϕ(0) = 0, lim u→∞ ϕ(u) = ∞ and is convex on [0, bϕ) (or on [0, bϕ] when ϕ(bϕ) < ∞), where bϕ = sup{u ≥ 0 : ϕ(u) < ∞}. We point out here that we allow ϕ(u) = ∞ for each u > 0. In such a case the corresponding Orlicz space Lϕ contains only the zero function. Given a measure space (�,�,μ), a function ϕ : � × [0,∞) → [0,∞] is called the Musielak–Orlicz function if the following conditions hold: 1. ϕ(t, ·) is a Young function for μ-a.e. t ∈ �, 2. ϕ(·, u) is a measurable function for each u ∈ [0,∞). Let ϕ be a Musielak–Orlicz function. We define the convex modular Iϕ on L 0 as Iϕ(x) = ∫ � ϕ(t, |x(t)|)dμ(t). The Musielak–Orlicz space Lϕ is defined as Lϕ = {x ∈ L0 : Iϕ(λx) < ∞ for some λ > 0} and is equipped with the Luxemburg–Nakano norm ‖x‖ϕ = inf { λ > 0 : Iϕ( x λ ) ≤ 1 } . It is known that Musielak–Orlicz spaces have the Fatou property. Moreover, it follows immediately from the definition, that suppLϕ = {t ∈ � : bϕ(t) > 0} (up to a set of measure zero). In case, ϕ does not depend on t , the Musielak–Orlicz space Lϕ is just the Orlicz space. For a givenMusielak–Orlicz functionϕwedefine twouseful (functions) parameters aϕ(t) = sup{u ≥ 0 : ϕ(t, u) = 0}, bϕ(t) = inf{u ≥ 0 : ϕ(t, u) = ∞}. It is known, that both aϕ and bϕ are measurable [4, Proposition 5.1]. Furthermore, we define the right-continuous inverse at point t ∈ � ϕ −1 (t, u) := inf{v ≥ 0 : ϕ(t, v) > u}. 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 493 Properties of ϕ−1 for a Young function ϕ have been collected in [11, Lemma 3.1]. The following basic relation between the norm and the modular will be used fre- quently through the paper ‖x‖ϕ ≤ 1 ⇒ Iϕ(x) ≤ ‖x‖ϕ , (2.2) for x ∈ Lϕ (see [15, Theorem 1.1]). More information onMusielak–Orlicz and Orlicz spaces can be found for example in [7–9,19]. 3 Auxiliary results Recall that our goal is to describe the space of pointwise multipliers M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) between two Musielak–Orlicz spaces and thus we will operate on two Musielak– Orlicz functions ϕ, ϕ1, both defined over the same measure space �. The result will be given in terms of the third Musielak–Orlicz function ϕ �ϕ1—the Young conjugate of ϕ1 with respect to ϕ. In order to define it we need to introduce the following decomposition of the continuous part of the domain � depending on behaviour of both ϕ, ϕ1. Let ϕ, ϕ1 be two Musielak–Orlicz functions. We define the following sets: �0,0 := {t ∈ �c : bϕ1(t) = bϕ(t) = ∞}, �0,∞ := {t ∈ �c : bϕ1(t) = ∞, bϕ(t) < ∞}, �∞,0 := {t ∈ �c : 0 < bϕ1(t) < ∞, bϕ(t) = ∞}, �∞,∞ := {t ∈ �c : 0 < bϕ1(t) < ∞, bϕ(t) < ∞}, �∞ := �∞,∞ ∪ �∞,0. Given two Musielak–Orlicz functions ϕ, ϕ1 over the same measure space �, the Young conjugate of ϕ1 with respect to ϕ is defined as ϕ � ϕ1(t, u) := { sup{ϕ(t, su) − ϕ1(t, s) : 0 ≤ s < bϕ1(t)} if t ∈ �c, sup{ϕ(t, su) − ϕ1(t, s) : 0 ≤ s ≤ min{1/ϕ−1 ( t, 1 μ({t}) ) , bϕ1 (t) 2 }} if t ∈ �a . Observe firstly that such defined function ϕ � ϕ1 satisfies bϕ�ϕ1(t) > 0 for each t ∈ �a . Moreover, it is easy to see, that for t ∈ �0,∞ ϕ � ϕ1(t, u) = { 0 if u = 0, ∞ if u > 0. In consequence, supp(Lϕ�ϕ1) = (�0,0 ∪ �∞ ∪ �a) ∩ supp(Lϕ) (3.1) It may be instructive to realize what is ϕ � ϕ1, when ϕ, ϕ1 are Nakano functions. 123 494 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski Example 1 Let p, q : � → [1,∞) be two measurable functions and define ϕ(t, u) = 1 q(t)u q(t), ϕ1(t, u) = 1p(t)u p(t) for t ∈ �, u ≥ 0. Assume that q(t) ≤ p(t) for a.e. t ∈ �. One can easily calculate that ϕ � ϕ1(t, u) = 1 r(t) ur(t) where 1p(t) + 1r(t) = 1q(t) for a.e. t ∈ �. Finally, we shall see that ϕ�ϕ1 satisfies assumptions ofMusielak–Orlicz functions. Lemma 2 Given two Musielak–Orlicz functions ϕ, ϕ1 over the same measure space �, the function ϕ � ϕ1 is also the Musielak–Orlicz function on �. Proof It is already known that ϕ �ϕ1(t, ·) is a Young function for a.e. t ∈ � (see [11, 13]). Thus we need only to prove measurability of ϕ � ϕ1(·, u) for each u ≥ 0. Each component of�may be considered separately. We will explain only situation on�∞, since the remaining cases are either simpler, or evident. Firstly we observe that for each u ≥ 0 and t ∈ �∞ ϕ � ϕ1(t, u) = sup{ϕ(t, su) − ϕ1(t, s) : 0 ≤ s < bϕ1(t)} = sup{ϕ(t, ubϕ1(t)v) − ϕ1(t, bϕ1(t)v) : 0 ≤ v < 1} = sup{ϕ(t, ubϕ1(t)v) − ϕ1(t, bϕ1(t)v) : v ∈ Q ∩ [0, 1)}. However, functions ϕ(·, ubϕ1(·)v) and ϕ1(·, bϕ1(·)v) are measurable by properties of Musielak–Orlicz functions. In consequence, ϕ � ϕ1(·, u) is measurable, as the supremum of countable collection of measurable functions. In the proof of the main theorem, we are going to imitate inductive argument used in [5] and in [13]. In order to do it we need a kind of decomposition of the measure space �. The following two lemmas provide it. Lemma 3 Let (�,�,μ) be non-atomic and let ϕ be a Musielak–Orlicz function such that bϕ(t) = ∞ for μ-a.e. t ∈ �. For each a > 0 there exists a sequence of pairwise disjoint measurable sets (An) such that ⋃ n∈N An = � and ∥∥χAn ∥∥ ϕ ≤ 1 a for every n ∈ N. Proof Fix a > 0. Define the sets Bn := {t ∈ � : n − 1 ≤ ϕ(t, a) < n} for n ∈ N. Evidently, each Bn is measurable, since the function ϕ(·, a) is measurable. Moreover ⋃ n∈N Bn = � and (Bn) is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets. Since 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 495 we operate on a non-atomic measure space, each Bn may be divided further into a sequence (finite or not) of pairwise disjoint sets (Cnj ) j∈In such that ⋃ j∈In C n j = Bn and μ(Cnj ) ≤ 1n for each j ∈ In . In consequence, we have for n ∈ N and j ∈ In Iϕ ( aχCnj ) = ∫ Cnj ϕ(t, a)dμ(t) ≤ μ(Cnj ) sup t∈Cnj ϕ(t, a) ≤ 1. It follows that ∥∥∥χCnj ∥∥∥ ϕ ≤ 1 a , for every n ∈ N and j ∈ In . Finally, we get the desired sequence (An) just by rearranging the (doubly indexed) sequence (Cnj ). Lemma 4 Let (�,�,μ) be non-atomic and let ϕ be a Musielak–Orlicz function such that 0 < bϕ(t) < ∞ for μ-a.e. t ∈ �. There exists a sequence of pairwise disjoint measurable sets (An) such that ⋃ n∈N An = � and for each n ∈ N ∥∥χAn ∥∥ ϕ ≤ 2 ess sup t∈An {bϕ(t)} . Proof For each k ∈ Z define Bk := {t ∈ � : 2k−1 < bϕ(t) ≤ 2k}. Evidently, sets Bk are measurable, since bϕ is a measurable function. Next, for each k ∈ Z and n ∈ N we define Bk,n := {t ∈ Bk : n − 1 ≤ ϕ(t, 2k−1) < n}. Then the doubly indexed sequence (Bk,n) consists of pairwise disjoint measurable sets such that ⋃ n∈N,k∈Z Bk,n = �. Denote I := {(k, n) ∈ Z2 : Bk,n = ∅}. For each (k, n) ∈ I we can further decompose Bk,n into a (finite or not) sequence (Ck,nj ) j∈Ik,n of pairwise disjoint measurable sets in such a way that ⋃ j∈Ik,n Ck,nj = Bk,n and μ(Ck,nj ) ≤ 1n for each j ∈ Ik,n . Finally, for every (k, n) ∈ I and j ∈ Ik,n we have 123 496 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski Iϕ ( 2k−1χ Ck,nj ) = ∫ Ck,nj ϕ(t, 2k−1)dμ(t) ≤ μ(Ck,nj ) sup t∈Ck,nj ϕ(t, 2k−1) ≤ 1. In consequence, ∥∥∥∥χCk,nj ∥∥∥∥ ϕ ≤ 1 2k−1 ≤ 2 ess sup t∈Bk,n {bϕ(t)} ≤ 2 ess sup t∈Ck,nj {bϕ(t)} . Similarly as before, the desired sequence is obtained after rearranging the (triple indexed) sequence (Ck,nj ). Fact 5 If a Musielak–Orlicz function ϕ is such that bϕ(t) < ∞ for a.e. t ∈ �, then Lϕ ⊂ L∞(1/bϕ). Proof Let 0 ≤ y /∈ L∞(1/bϕ). For each n ∈ N we define sets An = {t ∈ � : n ≤ y(t) bϕ(t) }. Then there is N ∈ N such that μ(An) > 0 for n ≥ N . Fix a > 0 and choose n ≥ N satisfying an > 2. We can see that nbϕχAn ≤ y. In consequence, Iϕ (ay) ≥ Iϕ ( anbϕχAn ) ≥ Iϕ (2bϕχAn ) = ∞. Since a > 0 was arbitrary we conclude that y /∈ Lϕ. Lemma 6 Let (�,�,μ) be non-atomic and let ϕ, ϕ1 be two Musielak–Orlicz functions such that 0 < bϕ1(t) < ∞ and 0 < bϕ(t) < ∞ for μ-a.e. t ∈ �. Then M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) ⊂ L∞(bϕ1/bϕ). Proof Let 0 ≤ y /∈ L∞(v), where v(t) := bϕ1 (t)bϕ(t) . For each n ∈ N we define An = {t ∈ � : n ≤ y(t)v(t) < n + 1}. 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 497 Then there exist infinitely many n ∈ N for which μ(An) > 0. Denote the set of such n’s by I . Next, since � is non-atomic, for each n ∈ I there is Bn ⊂ An such that μ(Bn) > 0 and ∫ Bn ϕ1 ( t, bϕ1(t) 2 ) dμ(t) ≤ 1 2n . We define f (t) := ∞∑ n=1 bϕ1(t) 2 χBn . Then Iϕ1 ( f ) = ∫ ϕ1(t, f (t))dμ(t) = ∞∑ n=1 ∫ Bn ϕ1 ( t, bϕ1(t) 2 ) dμ(t) ≤ 1. It means that f ∈ Lϕ1 and ‖ f ‖ϕ1 ≤ 1. However, y(t) f (t) ≥ 1 2 y(t)bϕ1(t) ≥ n 2 bϕ(t) for a.e. t ∈ Bn, which implies that y f /∈ Lϕ , since Lϕ ⊂ L∞( 1bϕ ) by Fact 5. Consequently, y /∈ M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) and the proof is finished. Lemma 7 Suppose (�,�,μ) is non-atomic and let ϕ, ϕ1 be Musielak–Orlicz func- tions such that suppLϕ1 = �. Then μ(suppM(Lϕ1, Lϕ)\�0,0 ∪ �∞) = 0. Proof We need only to show that μ(�0,∞ ∩ suppM(Lϕ1, Lϕ)) = 0. Suppose, for a contrary, there exists A ⊂ �0,∞ such that μ(A) > 0 and χA ∈ M(Lϕ1, Lϕ). Let C ⊂ A be chosen in such a way thatμ(C) > 0 and inf t∈C bϕ(t) = δ > 0. From Lemma 3 it follows that for each n ∈ N there exists An ⊂ C such that μ(An) > 0 and ∥∥χAn ∥∥ ϕ1 ≤ 1 n . 123 498 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski Moreover, by Fact 5, we know that Lϕ[�0,∞] ⊂ L∞( 1bϕ )[�0,∞] with some inclusion constant c > 0. It means ∥∥χAn ∥∥ ϕ ≥ c−1 ∥∥χAn ∥∥ L∞( 1bϕ ) ≥ c−1 sup t∈An 1 bϕ(t) = 1 c inf t∈An bϕ(t) ≥ 1 c inf t∈C bϕ(t) = 1 cδ . Finally, for each n ∈ N define xn := nχAn . Then ‖xn‖Lϕ1 ≤ 1 and it follows ‖χA‖M ≥ ‖xnχA‖ϕ = ∥∥nχAn ∥∥ ϕ ≥ n cδ , for each n ∈ N. In consequence, χA /∈ M(Lϕ1, Lϕ)which contradicts our assumption. Of course, the supremum in definition of function ϕ � ϕ1 need not be attained. To avoid such a situation, we introduce a truncated version of ϕ � ϕ1 (cf. [13, Definition 1]). Namely, for a > 0 we define the function ϕ �a ϕ1 in the following way ϕ �a ϕ1(t, u) := ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ sup{ϕ(t, su) − ϕ1(t, s) : 0 ≤ s ≤ a} if t ∈ �0,0 ∪ �0,∞ sup{ϕ(t, su) − ϕ1(t, s) : 0 ≤ s ≤ aa+1bϕ1 (t)} if t ∈ �∞ sup{ϕ(t, su) − ϕ1(t, s) : 0 ≤ s ≤ min{1/ϕ−1 ( t, 1 μ({t}) ) , bϕ1 (t) 2 }} if t ∈ �a Using exactly the same reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 2 one can see that ϕ �a ϕ1 is the Musielak–Orlicz function over �. Furthermore, it is easy to see that bϕ�aϕ1(t) = (a + 1)bϕ(t) abϕ1(t) (3.2) for t ∈ �∞. Lemma 8 Let (�,�,μ) be non-atomic and let ϕ, ϕ1 be Musielak–Orlicz functions such that suppLϕ1 = �. If A ⊂ suppLϕ\�∞,0 is a set of positive measure and numbers a > 1, u > 0 satisfy ϕ �a ϕ1 ( t, 32u ) < ∞ for a.e. t ∈ A, then the function x : A → R+, defined by x(t) :=max { 0≤v≤min { a, a a+1bϕ1(t) } : ϕ1(t, v)+ϕ �a ϕ1(t, u)=ϕ(t, uv) } , is measurable. 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 499 Proof Without loss of generality we may assume that ϕ1(t, ·), ϕ(t, ·) are Young func- tions for each t ∈ A. Fix u > 0 and a > 1 satisfying ϕ �a ϕ1 ( t, 3 2 u ) < ∞ for a.e.t ∈ A (3.3) and let x be like in the statement. Let (rk) be a dense sequence in [0, a]. For each k, n ∈ N define Bnk := { t ∈ A : rk ≤ a a + 1bϕ1(t), ϕ1(t, rk) + ϕ �a ϕ1(t, u) − ϕ(t, urk) < 1/n } and qnk := rkχBnk . Just notice that by the definition of ϕ �a ϕ1 0 ≤ ϕ1(t, v) + ϕ �a ϕ1(t, w) − ϕ(t, wv) for a.e. t ∈ � and w, v ≥ 0. Therefore, ϕ(t, urk) < ∞, because for every k ∈ N we have ϕ1(t, rk) < ∞ and ϕ �a ϕ1(t, u) < ∞. Of course, functions qnk are measurable, since sets B n k are measurable. We will show that x = lim sup k,n→∞ qnk . (3.4) Firstly we will explain the inequality lim supk,n→∞ q n k ≤ x . Suppose, for a contradic- tion, that for some t0 ∈ A and some δ > 0 there holds lim sup k,n→∞ qnk (t0) > x(t0) + δ. This implies that there is a (singly-indexed) sequence (qniki ) such thatmin{a, a a+1bϕ1 (t0)} ≥ qniki (t0) > x(t0) + δ, ni , ki → ∞ and ϕ1(t0, uqniki (t0)) + ϕ �a ϕ1(t0, u) − ϕ(t0, uqniki (t0)) < 1/ni (3.5) for each i = 1, 2, 3, . . .. On the other hand, there is a subsequence (q j ) := (q ni j ki j ) of (qniki ) and q0 > x(t0) such that q j (t0) → q0. However, by (3.5) and continuity of respective functions, we get ϕ1(t0, q0) + ϕ �a ϕ1(t0, u) − ϕ(t0, uq0) = 0, 123 500 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski which contradicts maximality of x(t0) and proves inequality lim supk,n→∞ q n k ≤ x . To see the opposite inequality fix t ∈ A and denote Cn := { 0 ≤ v≤min { a, a a+1bϕ1(t) } : ϕ1(t, v)+ϕ �a ϕ1(t, u) − ϕ(t, uv)<1/n } . We see that sets Cn are open and non-empty, since x(t) ∈ Cn for each n. Therefore, one can select a sequence (rni ) such that rni ∈ Ci and rni → x(t). Then t ∈ Bini for each i = 1, 2, 3, . . . and, consequently, x(t) ≤ lim sup k,n→∞ qnk (t), which finally proves measurability of x . 4 Pointwise multipliers Theorem 9 Let ϕ, ϕ1 be Musielak–Orlicz functions over a measure space (�,�,μ) and assume that suppLϕ1 = �. Then M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) = Lϕ�ϕ1 . Proof Without loss of generality we can assume that supp(Lϕ) = �, since M(Lϕ1, Lϕ)[�\supp(Lϕ)] = {0} = Lϕ�ϕ1 [�\supp(Lϕ)], where the second equality follows from (3.1). The proof of inclusion Lϕ�ϕ1 ⊂ M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) is the same as in the case of Orlicz spaces and we omit it (see for example [13, Lemma 6]). We only need to prove the remaining inclusion M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) ⊂ Lϕ�ϕ1 Let 0 ≤ y ∈ M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) be a simple function such that ‖y‖M ≤ 14c , where c ≥ 1 is the constant of inclusion M(Lϕ1, Lϕ)[�∞,∞] ⊂ L∞(bϕ1/bϕ)[�∞,∞] (cf. Lemma 6). We will show that Iϕ�aϕ1(y) ≤ 1 (4.1) for every a > 1. 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 501 To prove this inequality, for each a > 1 we will construct a function x(t) on � and a family of pairwise disjoint sets (An) satisfying: (i) ϕ �a ϕ1(t, y(t)) = ϕ(t, x(t)y(t)) − ϕ1(t, x(t)) for a.e t ∈ �, (ii) ∥∥xyχAn ∥∥ ϕ ≤ 12 for each n ∈ N, (iii) supp(M(Lϕ1, Lϕ)) ⊂ ⋃ n∈N An , (iv) x ∈ Lϕ1 and ‖x‖ϕ1 ≤ 1. Let a > 1. Since y is a simple function we can write it in the form y = n∑ k=0 bkχBk + m∑ k=0 dkχ{ωk }, where for every k we have bk, dk > 0, Bk ⊂ �∞ ∪ �0,0, μ(Bk) < ∞ and ωk’s are atoms. In order to construct the desired function x , we will apply Lemma 8 for each bk and Bk . First of all we need to show that assumptions of Lemma 8 are fulfilled, i.e. for each 0 ≤ k ≤ n we have ϕ �a ϕ1 ( t, 32bk ) < ∞ for a.e. t ∈ Bk . Let 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Then for a.e. t ∈ Bk we have bk = y(t) ≤ bϕ�ϕ1(t) 4 ≤ bϕ�aϕ1(t) 2 , since, by Lemma 6, ∥∥∥yb−1ϕ�ϕ1χ�∞,∞ ∥∥∥ ∞ ≤ c ∥∥yχ�∞,∞ ∥∥ M ≤ 1 4 and bϕ�aϕ1(t) = ∞ for a.e. t ∈ �0,0 ∪ �∞,0. Consequently ϕ �a ϕ1(t, 32bk) < ∞ for a.e. t ∈ Bk . Thus using Lemma 8 for the set Bk and the number bk we obtain measurable function xk(t) on Bk such that ϕ �a ϕ1(t, y(t)) = ϕ(t, xk(t)y(t)) − ϕ1(t, xk(t)) and 0 ≤ xk(t) ≤ min{a, aa+1bϕ1(t)} for a.e. t ∈ Bk . Now we will consider the atomic part. For every 0 ≤ k ≤ m let ck > 0 satisfy 0 ≤ ck ≤ min { 1/ϕ−1 ( ωk, 1 μ({ωk}) ) , bϕ1(ωk) 2 } and ϕ �a ϕ1(ωk, y(ωk)) = ϕ(ωk, ck y(ωk)) − ϕ1(ωk, ck). Such numbers exist, since the supremum in definition of ϕ �a ϕ1 is taken over a compact set. 123 502 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski The function satisfying (i) is defined as x(t) := ⎧⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ xk(t) if t ∈ Bk, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, ck if t = ωk, 0 ≤ k ≤ m, 0 if t /∈ supp(y). In the next step we will determine sets (An) satisfying (ii) and (iii). We start with �∞. By Lemma 4 there exists a sequence of pairwise disjoint mea- surable sets (A1n) such that ⋃ n∈N A1n = �∞ and ∥∥∥χA1n ∥∥∥ ϕ1 ≤ 2 sup t∈A1n {bϕ1(t)} , for every n ∈ N. Since 0 ≤ x(t) < bϕ1(t), we have ∥∥∥xyχA1n ∥∥∥ ϕ ≤ sup t∈A1n {bϕ1(t)} ‖y‖M ∥∥∥χA1n ∥∥∥ ϕ1 ≤ 1 2 , (4.2) and therefore sets (A1n) satisfy (ii). Secondly, byLemma3, there exists a sequence (A2n) of pairwise disjointmeasurable sets such that ⋃ n∈N A2n = �0,0 and ∥∥∥χA2n ∥∥∥ ϕ1 ≤ 1 a . Moreover, we have ∥∥∥xyχA2n ∥∥∥ ϕ ≤ a 2 ∥∥∥χA2n ∥∥∥ ϕ1 ≤ 1 2 , (4.3) because x(t) ≤ a. Considering the atomic part, let’s observe that for each ω ∈ �a ∥∥xyχ{ω} ∥∥ ϕ ≤ 1 2ϕ−1(ω, 1 μ({ω}) ) ∥∥χ{ω} ∥∥ ϕ1 = 1 2 , (4.4) where the last equality follows by ∥∥χ{ω} ∥∥ ϕ1 = ϕ−1(ω, 1 μ({ω}) ). Therefore, we can take atoms as desired sets. Finally, it is enough to renumerate the sequences (A1n), (A 2 n), ({ω})ω∈supp(M(Lϕ1 ,Lϕ))a into one sequence (An). By Lemma 7, supp(M(Lϕ1, Lϕ)) ⊂ ⋃ n∈N An, 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 503 thus the construction of desired sets (An) is finished. It just left to show that (iv) is fulfilled, i.e. ‖x‖ϕ1 ≤ 1. In order to prove it, we define functions xn := n∑ k=1 xχAk and we will inductively show that Iϕ1 (xn) ≤ 1 2 . Since xn ↑ x a.e., from the Fatou property, it will follow that x ∈ Lϕ1 and ‖x‖ϕ1 ≤ sup n ‖xn‖ϕ1 ≤ 1. Firstly we need to show that for every k ∈ N there holds ∥∥xχAk ∥∥ ϕ1 ≤ 1 2 . (4.5) From the equality ϕ �a ϕ1(t, y(t)) = ϕ(t, x(t)y(t)) − ϕ1(t, x(t)) we obtain two inequalities ϕ1(t, x(t)) ≤ ϕ(t, x(t)y(t)) for a.e. t ∈ �, (4.6) ϕ �a ϕ1(t, y(t)) ≤ ϕ(t, x(t)y(t)) for a.e. t ∈ �. (4.7) From (4.6) and by inequality ∥∥xyχAk ∥∥ ϕ ≤ 12 we have Iϕ1 ( xχAk ) = ∫ Ak ϕ1(t, x(t))dμ(t) ≤ ∫ Ak ϕ(t, y(t)x(t))dμ(t) = Iϕ ( yxχAk ) ≤ 1 2 (4.8) for every k ∈ N, where the last inequality follows from (2.2). In particular, Iϕ1 (x1) ≤ 12 , and we can proceed with the induction. Let n ≥ 1 and suppose that Iϕ1 (xn) ≤ 1 2 . We have Iϕ1 (xn+1) = Iϕ1 (xn) + Iϕ1 ( xχAn+1 ) ≤ 1 and thus ‖xn+1‖ϕ1 ≤ 1. Similarly, as in inequality (4.8), we obtain Iϕ1 (xn+1) ≤ Iϕ (yxn+1) ≤ 1 2 , 123 504 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski by ‖yxn+1‖ϕ ≤ 12 ‖xn+1‖ϕ1 ≤ 12 . It means that (4.5) is proved and (iv) follows. Finally, we are ready to show that Iϕ�aϕ1(y) ≤ 1. We have ‖yx‖ϕ ≤ ‖y‖M ‖x‖ϕ1 ≤ 1 2 and from inequality (4.7) we obtain Iϕ�aϕ1 (y) = ∫ ϕ �a ϕ1(t, y(t))dμ(t) ≤ ∫ ϕ(t, y(t)x(t))dμ(t) = Iϕ (yx) ≤ 1. Clearly, ϕ �a ϕ1(t, y(t)) ↑ ϕ � ϕ1(t, y(t)) for a.e. t ∈ � when a ↑ ∞. Applying the Fatou lemma we have Iϕ�ϕ1 (y) = ∫ � ϕ � ϕ1(t, y(t))dμ(t) ≤ lim inf a→∞ ∫ � ϕ �a ϕ1(t, y(t))dμ(t) ≤ 1, which proves the inequality (4.1). It means that y ∈ Lϕ�ϕ1 and ‖y‖ϕ�ϕ1 ≤ 1. Concluding, if 0 ≤ y ∈ M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) is a simple function, then y ∈ Lϕ�ϕ1 and ‖y‖ϕ�ϕ1 ≤ 4c ‖y‖M . Thus the theorem is proved for positive simple functions. We will once again use the Fatou property to complete the argument for an arbitrary function. Let now y ∈ M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) be arbitrary. There exists a sequence of simple functions (yn) such that 0 ≤ yn ↑ |y| a.e. on �. Since M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) is a Banach ideal space, ‖yn‖M ≤ ‖y‖M for every n ∈ N. From the Fatou property of Lϕ�ϕ1 we have y ∈ Lϕ�ϕ1 and ‖y‖ϕ�ϕ1 ≤ sup n∈N ‖yn‖ϕ�ϕ1 ≤ 4c ‖yn‖M ≤ 4c ‖y‖M , which finishes the proof. In the special case of variable exponent spaces we have the following corollary. It has been recently proved in [10] using elementary methods. Recall that the variable exponent space (or Nakano space) is defined as L p(·) := Lϕ , where ϕ(t, u) = u p(t), for a measurable function p : � → [1,∞). Corollary 10 Let (�,�,μ) be non-atomic and let p, q : � → [1,∞) be two mea- surable functions satisfying q(t) ≤ p(t) for μ-a.e. t ∈ �. Then M(L p(·), Lq(·)) = Lr(·), where 1p(t) + 1r(t) = 1q(t) for μ-a.e. t ∈ �. 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 505 Proof First of all, observe that eachNakano space L p(·) may be equivalently defined by the Musielak–Orlicz function ϕp(t, u) = 1p(t)u p(t). In fact, we see that for ϕ(t, u) = u p(t) there holds ϕ ( t, u 2 ) = (u 2 )p(t) ≤ 1 p(t) u p(t) = ϕp(t, u) ≤ ϕ(t, u), for each t ∈ � and u > 0, which means that L p(·) = Lϕp . Now the proof follows directly from Example 1 and the above theorem. 5 Pointwise products If ϕ, ϕ1, ϕ2 are Musielak–Orlicz functions we write ϕ −1 1 ϕ −1 2 ≺ ϕ−1 if there exists a constant C > 0 such that Cϕ−11 (t, u)ϕ −1 2 (t, u) ≤ ϕ−1(t, u) for a.e. t ∈ � and each u ≥ 0. Similarly, we write ϕ−11 ϕ−12 � ϕ−1 if there exists a constant C > 0 such that for a.e. t ∈ � and each u ≥ 0 Cϕ−11 (t, u)ϕ −1 2 (t, u) ≥ ϕ−1(t, u). Moreover, ϕ−11 ϕ −1 2 ≈ ϕ−1 means that ϕ−11 ϕ−12 ≺ ϕ−1 and ϕ−11 ϕ−12 � ϕ−1. Recall the classical Lozanovskii factorization theorem (see [14, Theorem 6], cf. [6]) which says that each Banach ideal space E factorizes L1, this is E � M(E, L1) = L1. Generalizing this idea, for a couple of Banach ideal spaces E, F we say that E fac- torizes F if E � M(E, F) = F, (see [12, Section 6] for a discussion of the general factorization problem). Recently the authors proved in [13, Theorem 2] that for a pair of Young functions ϕ, ϕ1, the function space Lϕ1 may be factorized by Lϕ if and only if ϕ −1 1 (ϕ � ϕ1)−1 ≈ ϕ−1. (5.1) That result is based on Theorem 5 in [12], which states that in the case of non-atomic and finite measure space, given three Young functions ϕ, ϕ0, ϕ1, there holds Lϕ � Lϕ1 = Lϕ0 if and only if ϕ −1 1 ϕ −1 0 ≈ ϕ−1. 123 506 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski In this section we will show that, in the case of Musielak–Orlicz spaces, the condi- tion (5.1) is sufficient, but not necessary to have the factorization Lϕ � Lϕ1 = Lϕ0 . An immediate consequence of Theorem 9 is the following inclusion. Lemma 11 Let ϕ, ϕ1 be Musielak–Orlicz functions over (�,�,μ). If supp(Lϕ1) = � then Lϕ ⊂ Lϕ�ϕ1 � Lϕ1 Proof Let x ∈ Lϕ�ϕ1 and y ∈ Lϕ1 . Then, since M(Lϕ1, Lϕ) = Lϕ�ϕ1 , we see that xy ∈ Lϕ and ‖xy‖ϕ ≤ ‖x‖M ‖y‖ϕ1 ≤ c ‖x‖ϕ�ϕ1 ‖y‖ϕ1 . Lemma 12 Let ϕ, ϕ0, ϕ1 be Musielak–Orlicz functions over (�,�,μ). Assume that ϕ −1 1 ϕ −1 0 � ϕ−1 and suppLϕ1 = �. Then Lϕ ⊂ Lϕ0 � Lϕ1 . Proof Denote by c ≥ 1 the constant of inclusion Lϕ[�∞,∞] ⊂ L∞(b−1ϕ )[�∞,∞]. Let 0 ≤ z ∈ Lϕ be such that ‖z‖ϕ = 23c . Put y(t) := ϕ(t, z(t)). We have y(t) < ∞ a.e., since z(t) ≤ 23bϕ(t). For i = 0, 1, define zi (t) := ⎧⎨ ⎩ ϕ −1 i (t, y(t)) √ z(t) ϕ −1 0 (t,y(t))ϕ −1 1 (t,y(t)) if t ∈ supp(z) 0 if t /∈ supp(z) Note that z = z0z1. We will show that zi ∈ Lϕi for i = 0, 1. Let D > 0 be such that Dϕ−11 (t, u)ϕ −1 0 (t, u) ≥ ϕ−1(t, u). We claim that ϕi ( t, zi (t)√ D ) ≤ y(t). (5.2) If y(t) = 0 then zi (t) = aϕ(t) √ z(t) aϕ0(t)aϕ1(t) ≤ aϕ(t) √ aϕ(t) aϕ0(t)aϕ1(t) ≤ aϕ(t) √ D 123 Pointwise multipliers of Musielak–Orlicz spaces and… 507 thus ϕi ( t, zi (t)√ D ) = 0. If y(t) > 0 then zi (t) = ϕ−1i (t, y(t)) √ z(t) ϕ −1 0 (t, y(t))ϕ −1 1 (t, y(t)) ≤ ϕ−1i (t, y(t)) √ Dz(t) ϕ−1(t, y(t)) = ϕ−1i (t, y(t)) √ Dz(t) z(t) = ϕ−1i (t, y(t)) √ D. Therefore, ϕi ( t, zi (t)√ D ) ≤ ϕi (t, ϕ−1i (t, y(t))) = y(t) and the claim is proved. Integrating both sides in (5.2) we obtain Iϕi ( zi√ D ) ≤ Iϕ (z) ≤ 1, for i = 0, 1. It follows, that ‖zi‖ϕi ≤ √ D ≤ √ 2Dc ‖z‖ϕ. This means that z ∈ Lϕ0 � Lϕ1 and ‖z‖Lϕ0�Lϕ1 ≤ 2Dc ‖z‖ϕ . Recall that for Musielak–Orlicz functions ϕ, ϕ1, the generalized Young inequality implies that ϕ −1 1 (ϕ � ϕ1)−1 ≺ ϕ−1 (see for example [11]). Corollary 13 Let ϕ, ϕ1 be Musielak–Orlicz functions over a measure space (�,�,μ). If ϕ−11 (ϕ � ϕ1)−1 ≈ ϕ−1 then Lϕ1 factorizes Lϕ . Wefinish the paper providing an example,which shows that the opposite implication does not hold. In particular, Theorem 2 in [13] cannot be directly generalized to Musielak–Orlicz spaces. 123 508 K. Leśnik, J. Tomaszewski Example 14 Consider � = [0, 1/2) with the Lebesgue measure. Define the following Musielak–Orlicz functions ϕ(t, u) = max{u − t, 0}, ϕ1(t, u) = u, for t ∈ � and u ≥ 0. Then Lϕ = Lϕ1 = L1. Moreover, we have ϕ � ϕ1(t, u) = { 0 if 0 ≤ u ≤ 1 ∞ if u > 1, thus Lϕ�ϕ1 = L∞. In consequence, the factorization Lϕ1 � Lϕ�ϕ1 = Lϕ holds. On the other hand an easy computations show that (ϕ � ϕ1)−1(t, u) = 1, ϕ−1(t, u) = u + t, ϕ−11 (t, u) = u. We have ϕ−11 (t, u)(ϕ � ϕ1)−1(t, u) = u, thus there is no constant D such that Dϕ−11 (t, u)(ϕ � ϕ1)−1(t, u) ≥ ϕ−1(t, u) for every t ∈ � and u ≥ 0 (take for example u = 0 and t > 0). Hence ϕ −1 1 (ϕ � ϕ1)−1 � ϕ−1. Acknowledgements The authors have been partially supported by the Grant 04/43/SBAD/0114 from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.
