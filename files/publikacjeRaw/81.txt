The population structure, reproductive biology, age and growth, and diet of shortfin makos caught by pelagic longliners (2005–10) and bather protection nets (1978–2010) in the south-west Indian Ocean were investigated. Themean fork length (FL) of makos measured by observers on longliners targeting tuna, swordfish and sharks was similar, and decreased from east to west, with the smallest individuals occurring near the Agulhas Bank edge, June to November. Nearly all makos caught by longliners were immature, with equal sex ratio. Makos caught by bather protection nets were significantly larger, males weremore frequent, and 93%ofmales and 55%of females weremature. Agewas assessed from band counts of sectioned vertebrae, and a von Bertalanffy growthmodel fitted to sex-pooled length-at-age data predicted a birth size (L0) of 90 cm, maximum FL (LN) of 285 cm and growth coefficient (k) of 0.113 y �1 . Males matured at 190 cm FL, aged 7 years, and females at 250 cm, aged 15 years. Litter sizes ranged from nine to 14 pups, and the presence of gravid females in bather protection nets suggested that some pupping occurred in shelf waters. Teleosts (mainly Trachurus capensis) occurred in 84% of stomachs collected on longliners, whereas elasmobranchs (63.5%) were most common in samples collected from bather protection nets, followed by teleosts (43.1%) and cephalopods (36.5%). Larger prey size may be a factor that attracts large makos to coastal waters. Additional keywords: demography, GLM, pelagic longline fisheries, shark bycatch, stomach contents. Received 23 December 2013, accepted 1 May 2014, published online 24 September 2014 Introduction The shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque, 1810, family Lamnidae), hereafter called mako, is a fast-swimming and active shark with a wide distribution in tropical and temperate waters above 168C (Compagno 2001). It is a highly migratory species that inhabits the epipelagic zone down to,500m depth and also enters littoral waters (Casey and Kohler 1992; Loefer et al. 2005). Makos can reach 3.7m fork length (FL) and a weight of 600 kg, and they are sexually dimorphic, with females becoming longer and heavier than males (Compagno 2001). Ontogenetic and seasonal movements of makos give rise to demographically structured populations with high spatio- temporal variability. Makos exhibit sexual segregation (Mucientes et al. 2009) and also segregate by developmental stages (Nakano and Nagasawa 1996). Juvenile makos spend 90% of their time in the mixed layer near the surface, whereas adults dive much deeper (Holts and Bedford 1993; Sepulveda et al. 2004). Small immature makos observed near the coast of Chile suggest the existence of a nearshore pupping and nursery area in spring and summer (Bustamante and Bennett 2013). In the north-west (NW) Atlantic, juveniles migrate seasonally between offshore wintering grounds and summer feeding grounds over the shelf (Casey and Kohler 1992). Mean lengths of makos caught by longliners in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean differed by area and latitude (Buencuerpo et al. 1998). Cliff et al. (1990) foundmore large males than females in coastal bather protection nets in eastern South Africa, and catches increased in winter and spring. The diffusive and highly dispersive nature of mako populations is supported by the absence of clear genetic population structure (Heist et al. 1996; Schrey and Heist 2003). The reproductivemode ofmakos is aplacental viviparity, and the embryos develop by ingesting unfertilised ova supplied by their mother, a practice known as oophagy (Gilmore 1993). Information on mature and pregnant females is sparse (Semba et al. 2011), but litter and birth size, size at sexual maturity and parturition season have nevertheless been reported for popula- tions in several regions. Litter size mostly ranges from 4 to 26 embryos (Stevens 1983; Mollet et al. 2000) with a possible maximum of 30 (Mollet et al. 2002), and larger females produce CSIRO PUBLISHING Marine and Freshwater Research http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF13341 Journal compilation � CSIRO 2014 www.publish.csiro.au/journals/mfr david Typewritten Text Availability: 12 October 2014 IOTC-2014-WPEB10-INF12 david Typewritten Text david Typewritten Text david Typewritten Text more offspring. Parturition appears to occur year-round, with a peak in late winter and spring (Stevens 1983; Cliff et al. 1990; Duffy and Francis 2001; Semba et al. 2011). Size at birth is around 60 cm fork length (FL), based on the size of near-term embryos (58–67 cm FL; Duffy and Francis 2001; Semba et al. 2011) and the smallest observed free-swimming specimens (57–61 cm; Cliff et al. 1990; Mollet et al. 2000; Bustamante and Bennett 2013). Sexual maturity is reached at 2.5 to 2.9m FL in female makos, based on measurements of reproductive organs, the presence of fertilised ova and indications of past pregnancy or mating (Stevens 1983; Cliff et al. 1990; Mollet et al. 2000; Francis and Duffy 2005; Joung and Hsu 2005; Bishop et al. 2006).Males mature at a smaller FL of 1.7 to 2.0m, based on the calcification and development of claspers, which indicates the capacity to copulate (Maia et al. 2007; Semba et al. 2011; Bustamante and Bennett 2013). Estimates may vary according to sample size and the length range sampled, as well as the choice of maturity criteria and models (Francis and Duffy 2005; Semba et al. 2011). Real geographical or between-hemisphere differences in length-at-maturity have been suggested (Mollet et al. 2000), but estimates may have been affected by different length estimation methods used by individual researchers (Francis and Duffy 2005; Francis 2006). Previous studies on makos have mainly used counts of alternately deposited calcified (opaque) and less-calcified (translucent) bands in vertebral centra to estimate age (Pratt and Casey 1983; Bishop et al. 2006; Natanson et al. 2006; Semba et al. 2009; Wells et al. 2013). Annual deposition of bands has been validated for many shark species, and is now widely regarded as the norm (Francis et al. 2007). Nevertheless, some uncertainty remains over band deposition rates in makos. Most studies on makos have demonstrated the deposition of a single annual band pair (Campana et al. 2002; Ribot-Carballal et al. 2005; Natanson et al. 2006; Semba et al. 2009), but some have shown biannual deposition (Pratt and Casey 1983), at least in young age classes where growth is rapid (Wells et al. 2013). Uncertainty over band deposition rates can affect estimates of growth rates, longevity and age-at-maturity. Apart from the deposition rate, band widths in large makos become narrower and more compacted towards the periphery of the corpus calcareum, and this may lead to underestimation of ages when they become too narrow to distinguish, as found for porbeagle sharks (Francis et al. 2007). Various mechanical, chemical and digital methods have been developed to enhance vertebral bands, including the use of whole vertebrae or sections thereof, stains, X-rays and digital manipulation (Cailliet et al. 2006). Makos are apex predators in the open-ocean pelagic envi- ronment, and can influence the abundance of other species across a range of trophic levels (Cortés 1999; Kitchell et al. 2002; Rogers et al. 2012). They feed mainly on teleosts, other elasmobranchs, pelagic cephalopods and marine mammals (Stevens 1984; Cliff et al. 1990; Maia et al. 2006; Preti et al. 2012), but are opportunistic in that they may switch between prey groups depending on availability (MacNeil et al. 2005). Makos in the California current had a diverse diet of mainly teleosts and cephalopods, which was affected by season, size class and subregion (Preti et al. 2012). Makos caught in the NW Atlantic fed mainly on teleosts, with bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, making up .75% of the diet by volume (Stillwell and Kohler 1982; Wood et al. 2009). Cliff et al. (1990) found a large proportion of elasmobranchs in the stomachs of makos caught close to the shore in eastern South Africa. Large pelagic fish and cephalopods were dominant in the stomachs of juvenile and subadult makos sampled off southern Australia (Rogers et al. 2012). Makos are taken as by-catch in commercial longline and gill- net fisheries that target tuna and swordfish, as well as in directed shark fisheries and artisanal and recreational fisheries in tropical and temperate oceans (Francis et al. 2001; Campana et al. 2005; Petersen et al.2009;Bustamante andBennett 2013). In the south- west (SW) Indian Ocean, they are also taken as an incidental catch in bather protection nets, set in parallel and close to the shore (Dudley and Cliff 2010; Cliff and Dudley 2011). Statistics of mako catches made by international fishing fleets in the SW Indian Ocean are collected by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commis- sion (IOTC), but records probably under-represent actual catches because of inaccurate or incomplete reporting (IOTC 2012). The total reported mako catch from South Africa was 581 tonnes dressed weight in 2011 (DAFF 2012). Makos are characterised by low rates of population increase and high fishing mortality throughout their range, and hence are considered to be vulnerable to overfishing (Dulvy et al. 2008; IUCN 2013). Data collected by fisheries observers stationed on pelagic longliners and frommakos caught in bather protection nets were used to assess spatio-temporal size and sex distribution in the SW Indian Ocean. Biological information was used to estimate age and growth, size at sexual maturity, and the number and size of pups carried by pregnant females. Stomach contents were used to compare the diets of makos caught near the shore in bather protection nets with those caught in oceanic waters by longliners. This study provides new information on makos from the SW Indian Ocean, a part of the world where they have been little studied, and as such it complements studies from other oceans. Materials and methods Study area The study area off South Africa extended from Cape Point (188E) to the Mozambique border, and 200 nautical miles (nm) offshore to the boundary of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (Fig. 1). This part of the SW Indian Ocean is characterised by a narrow and steep continental shelf, which gradually broadens to form the shallow (,200m deep) Agulhas Bank in the west. The marine environment is dominated by the western boundary Agulhas Current, which flows in a south-westerly direction, roughly steered by the shelf edge (see Lutjeharms 2006 for a review). The current is highly dynamic, forming eddies, rings, inshore counter currents and filaments of warm Indian Ocean waters. Sea surface temperatures in the current are typically 23 to 268C, but coastal waters can range from 12 to 278C (Beckley 1983). Sampling gear and data collection Pelagic longline fleets generally use 12–120 km of longline, 500–3800 hooks and an American or Asian longline configu- ration, depending on the fleet (South African or Asian flagged B Marine and Freshwater Research J. C. Groeneveld et al. vessels) and target species (tuna, swordfish or sharks) (Petersen et al. 2009). The American system comprises a monofilament mainline and droppers, and a rope upper section and 50 cm of steel trace is also used when targeting sharks. The Asian tuna system uses a combination of braided monofilament, rope and a lead core to improve sinking rates. Circle and J-hookswith a size of 8/0 to 14/0 are commonly used. Bait comprises combinations of squid, mackerel and sardine. Longliners concentrate their fishing effort along the shelf break, near the 500m isobath (Fig. 1), and vessels targeting swordfish and sharks set their hooks at 30–50m depth, compared with 40–400m depth for tuna. Of all reported hooks set between 1998 and 2010, 4%were directed at sharks, 68% at tuna and 28% at swordfish. Makos are also captured in bather protection nets (anchored gill-nets set 300–500m from the shore; 51 cm stretched mesh) at swimming beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) (Fig. 1). Some 44 kmof nets in fixed positions along 325 km of coastline during the 1990s was reduced to 27.3 km by 2004, and in 2007 a further 4 km of nets were replaced with baited lines (Cliff and Dudley 2011). Nets are inspected each weekday at first light, when trapped animals are removed. Some nets are temporarily removed during winter, to avoid elevated shark catches associ- ated with the sardine run (Dudley and Cliff 2010). Fisheries observers stationed on pelagic longliners between 2005 and 2010 recorded the FL (cm), geographic coordinates and date of capture of 5819 makos (Fig. 1), and determined the sex of 525 individuals. The data were treated as the ‘offshore’ dataset. The sex, whole weight (WW, kg) and precaudal length (PCL, cm) or FL of 292 makos caught in bather protection nets between 1978 and 2010 were measured, and treated as the ‘coastal’ dataset. Fork length and PCLweremeasured as straight lines from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail and the precaudal notch, respectively. Precaudal length was converted to FL using the equation FL¼ 1.112� (PCL� 2.053) (Cliff et al. 1990). Possible bias inherent in length measurements of makos have been described by Francis (2006). Potential bias inherent in size selectivity of the various longline configura- tions was tested by comparing the length–frequency distribution ofmakos caught by tuna- and swordfish-directed longliners with that of shark-directed longliners. The offshore and coastal datasets were not combined because they differed greatly in terms of gear-types used, data-collection methods, and spatial and temporal coverage. Length–frequency and sex ratio analyses Variability in mako FL relative to sex, year, latitude, longitude, season and flag state (Table 1) was explored using generalised linear models (GLM) in the statistical software package R ver- sion 2.14.0 (R Development Core Team 2011). Final models were selected based on a stepwise approach, in which combi- nations of error structures, link functions and explanatory variables were trialled. The most parsimonious models were Shark longliners Tuna and swordfish longliners South Africa Africa KZN province Lesotho N Exclusive economic zone Protective shark nets Depth contours Kilometers 0 140 280 420 560 40�S 35�S 30�S 20�E 25�E 30�E 35�E Fig. 1.

Nets further south (Mzamba, 318050S) were removed in 2000. Nets are set parallel to beaches, 300–500m offshore, and are,214m long by 6.3m deep (Cliff and Dudley 2011). Population structure and biology of shortfin mako Marine and Freshwater Research C selected based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1974) and visual assessment of residual plots and quantile- quantile (QQ) probability plots (Table 2). For the offshore FL data, a gamma error structure and identity link function was selected as most appropriate after running trials on R software. Two-way (latitude� longitude; latitude� season; longitude� season) and three-way (latitude� longitude� season) interac- tions were tried, but theywere not significant andwere therefore omitted from the final model. A model was constructed in a similar way for the coastal FL data, but because of fewer records, year-groups were used instead of years (Table 2). A binomial error distribution with a logit link function was used to model sex distribution relative to year and season (Table 2). Size at maturity The inner clasper length of males was measured from the point of insertion at the cloaca to the tip of the clasper. Claspers with rigid calcification, a rhipidion (distal opening of the tube formed by the clasper) able to open freely to expose the spur, and anterior rotation capability were considered to bemature (Castro 1996). Fully grown but uncalcified claspers indicated adoles- cence. Bleeding claspers were interpreted as indicating recent mating activity. Females were considered mature if distinct oocytes were present in the ovary and the uteri appeared distended. A uterus width (UW). 50mm was used as an indicator of maturity; Mollet et al. (2000) found little overlap between mature and immature females at this measurement, although no evidence of knife-edge separation was found by Francis and Duffy (2005). Thin tube-like uteri were considered to be immature. The presence of a hymen indicated that a female was adolescent, although its absence is considered an unreliable indicator of maturity (Pratt 1979; Cliff et al. 1988; Francis and Duffy 2005). Mating scars on females were an indication of mating activity. The coefficients (a and b) of a logistic equation to estimate size at maturity of male and female makos, respectively, were estimated using a GLMwith a binomial error structure and logit link function (Table 2). In the model, sex was a categorical variable, and size was a continuous variable. The proportion of mature makos at each size was calculated as the inverse logit. The sizes at 25%, 50% and 75% probability of maturation, defining the mean size (L50) and maturation range (L25–L75), were calculated upon simulation with the inverse logit and the estimated parameters. Processing of vertebrae A total of 177 vertebral samples consisting of 5–8 vertebrae each (post-cranial or anterior to the dorsal fin) was collected on a shark-directed pelagic longliner in 2010, and 30 additional samples were excised from makos caught in bather protection nets.Muscle tissuewas removed from vertebrae and then soaked in 4.5% sodium hypochlorite for 45min to 12 h to remove fur- ther connective tissue (Yudin and Cailliet 1990). Cleaned ver- tebrae were embedded in polyester clear casting resin, and sectioned along the sagittal plane using an IsoMet low speed diamond saw (Beuhler-Whitby, Ontario, Canada). Sections of 0.8mm width were attached to glass slides with DPX slide adhesive. A Canon PowerShot S50 camera attached to a ste- reomicroscope was used to photograph sections in transmitted light on a dark field, and digital images were enhanced using the open source program Paint.NET. Band pairs, defined as one calcified (opaque) and one less calcified (translucent) band, were counted by two independent readers. The first opaque band distal to the focus was assumed to be a pre-birth band, and the second a birth-band associated with an angle change in the corpus calcareum (Wintner et al. 2002; Goldman et al. 2006; Natanson et al. 2006). The angle change is generally associated with the transition from fast intrauterine growth to slower post-natal growth (Walter and Ebert 1991), and was considered to represent age zero. Each opaque and translu- cent band thereafter was counted from digital images without prior knowledge of the length or sex of the specimen. Samples were counted three times by each reader, and the average percentage error (APE) was calculated to estimate the intra- reader average error (Beamish and Fournier 1981): APE ¼ 100 N XN i¼1 1 R XR j¼1 ðxij � xiÞ xi " # Table 1.

Counts that differed by $3 band pairs or had an APE of .20% were discarded. When the original counts differed by two band pairs, they were recounted. A paired t-test and an age- bias plot were used to assess inter-reader bias at the 5% level of significance (Neer et al. 2005; Natanson et al. 2006). Growth models Band pair deposition was assumed to occur annually, based on a mako injected with oxytetracycline (OTC) off eastern South Africa (Natanson et al. 2006) and radiocarbon methods (Cam- pana et al. 2002). The von Bertalanffy (VBM; von Bertalanffy 1938) and Gompertz growth models (GM; Ricker 1979) were used to fit growth curves to estimate the theoretical maximum length (LN), growth coefficient (k) and a theoretical age at zero length (t0) of makos. Natanson et al. (2006) found that the three- parameter VBM and GM produced biologically acceptable values for makos in the North Atlantic, and based on that study the original VBM, Lt ¼ L1 1� e�kðt�t0Þ h i was adapted as follows: Lt ¼ L1 � ðL1 � L0Þe�kt where Lt¼ predicted length at time t; LN¼ theoretical maxi- mum length; k¼ growth rate constant (y�1); and L0¼ length at birth. The GM was specified as: Lt ¼ L0feG½1�e ð�ktÞ�g where G¼ ln(LN/L0) is the initial exponential growth. The models were fit to individual length and age observations (averaged across readers and readings) by means of generalised nonlinear regression (in R-library nmle; Pinheiro et al. 2014), which allows for the comparison of different error structures. Makos grow fast during the first six months after birth (Bishop et al. 2006), but no neonates were represented in our aged material. The usual procedures of either fixing the size at birth (L0) or totally relaxing it resulted in fits that lacked biological realism.We therefore added four neonates with FL, 70 cm and an allocated age of 0.1 year to the growth data; this falls within the FL range reported for neonates (Semba et al. 2011).

Comparison of error structures and growth models in both sex-dependent and sex- pooled formulations was performed, and quality of fit tested by means of likelihood ratio tests. In situations when no significant differences (x 2 -test) were found among models or formulations, the least complex model (lower AIC) was selected. Confidence bands of growth equations were generated after non-parametric bootstrapping of the best fitting model. Analyses of stomach contents The prey items in stomachs of makos sampled on longliners at sea were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted. Prey items of makos collected from bather protection nets were counted and weighed in the laboratory. The percent- age contribution of a prey species in terms of number (%N), weight (%W) and frequency of occurrence (%F) in the stomachs examined were used to determine an index of relative impor- tance (IRI) following Hyslop (1980): IRI ¼ %F ð%Nþ%WÞ Results Length weight regressions The regressions between FL (cm) andWW(kg) ofmakos caught in bather protection nets were significant (P, 0.001) and the high r 2 values indicated that the models fitted the data well (Fig. 2). Female FL ranged from 91.5 to 311.3 cm compared with 102.4 to 252.4 cm inmales. Fork length andweight differed significantly between males and females (t-tests, P, 0.0001 in both cases), with females tending to be longer and heavier. Twenty females, but no males, exceeded 200 kg in weight. Length frequencies and sex ratios There was no significant difference in the mean FL (� s.d.) of makos caught by shark longliners, compared with those caught by longliners targeting tuna and swordfish (t-test, df¼ 1, P¼ 0.121; Fig. 3). Both gear types selected small to medium- sized makos, despite the presence of a steel trace on hooks used by shark longliners, or the differences in depth targeted by tuna- and shark-directed vessels. The mean FL of makos caught in bather protection nets (228.6� 26.5 cm, n¼ 290; Fig. 4) was larger than that ofmakos caught by pelagic longliners (combined data; 146.5� 34.5 cm, n¼ 5738) (t-test, df¼ 1, P, 0.001). Longitude, season and year of capture were significant explanatory variables of variation in mako FL in the gamma model of offshore data (Table 2). Vessel flag state did not affect offshore FL significantly, despite some differences in target species (generally tuna for Asian vessels; swordfish and sharks for local vessels), gear configurations and hook size preferences. The model showed an increase in mean FL from west to east over the study area, with the smallest individuals occurring at the edge of the Agulhas Bank and the largest ones near the Mozambique border (Fig. 4). On average, smaller makos were caught during winter (June to August) and spring (September to November) (Table 2).

In the gamma regression model of coastal data, sex and year- group were significant explanatory variables. The model pre- dicted a mean FL of 246 cm and 218 cm for females and males, respectively, for 2005–10 as reference period. By year-group, FL increased up to the early 1990s, and thereafter remained fairly constant, declining noticeably in 2005–10 (Fig. 5). Males dominated mako catches in bather protection nets from 1990, comprising 77–87% of the catch. Although the decline in mean size of makos in the latest year-group is minor, it might be explained by the proportionate reduction of the catch of females, which are normally larger, at that time. Size at maturity and reproduction Some 90% of males and nearly 99% of females caught offshore were immature, compared with only 45% of females and 7% of males in coastal catches. Clasper length and calcification increased steeply in males .140 cm FL. Clasper articulation was not present in males ,180 cm and became prevalent after 200 cm. Full clasper calcification and articulation was observed in all males with a FL. 215 cm.Male size at maturity (L50) was calculated as 190.2 cm, with a maturation range (L25–L75) of 182.4–198.0 cm, which indicates a steep transition to maturity (Fig. 6a). In total, 44 females were considered to be mature, and had a mean FL of 271.1� 17.3 cm. Females ,250 cm were often considered to be immature, because their UW did not exceed 50mm. L50 was estimated at 249.8 cm with a maturation range of 241.3–256.8 cm (Fig. 6b). Five gravid females captured in the bather protection nets ranged from 252 to 263 cm FL. Three of these carried pups; the litter sizes were 14 (mean FL � sd of 43.5� 1.8 cm), 12 (47.0� 1.1 cm) and nine (FL not measured). The other two possessed fertilised eggs in their uteri and bore mating scars on the pectoral fins and abdomen. A female stranded in the centre of the netted region had a litter of 9 (51.8� 1.6 cm). No gravid females were observed on the longliners. 60520390 Small: 140 cm Large: 230 cm FL 260 Kilometers 1300 N 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0 P ro p o rt io n 0.2 0.4 0.6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 90 120 150 180 Fork length (cm) 210 240 270 300 Mean FL � 153.0 � 28.9 cm n � 2825 Mean FL � 166.0 � 33.9 cm n � 234 Longliners – South coast Mean FL � 143.1 � 27.3 cm n � 2679 35�E30�E25�E20�E 35�S 30�S Namibia South Africa Botswana Mozambique 25�S Longliners – Agulhas Bank Longliners – East coast Mean FL � 228.6 � 26.5 cm n � 290 Bather protection nets Fig. 4.

Population structure and biology of shortfin mako Marine and Freshwater Research G Vertebral analyses Linear regressions of radius of post-cranial vertebrae (VR, mm) against FL were significant (P, 0.001) and fitted the data well for males (VR¼ 0.0799�FL� 2.6775, n¼ 46, r2¼ 0.92) and females (VR¼ 0.0776�FL� 2.4212, n¼ 43, r2¼ 0.95), respectively. No significant difference was found in the inter- cepts (P¼ 0.925) or slopes (P¼ 0.929) of the regressions, indicating that the VR increases linearly with FL, irrespective of growth rate differences between sexes. Therefore a sex-pooled regression was fitted as follows: VR¼ 0.0799�FL� 2.7166 (n¼ 89, r2¼ 0.94). Sections of 18mako vertebrae were unreadable, and a further 15 were rejected because replicate counts differed by.3 bands, or the APE was .20%. The remaining vertebral sections were from 43 females (91–297 cm FL) and 46 males (90–299 cm), and samples of at least twomakos of each sex were available per 10 cm length class between 130 and 230 cm. A pre-birth band- pair was observed in most vertebral sections, but an angle change in the corpus calcareum coinciding with the birth band was not always evident (see Natanson et al. 2006). The APE was 10.4% and 19.4% for primary and secondary readers, respectively, falling within the stipulated 20% error margin (see Campana 2001), and the accuracy of counts did not differ between readers (paired t-test; P. 0.05). The counts made by the two readers were strongly correlated (r 2¼ 0.97; P, 0.05) and were identical in 25% of all counts; there was 87% agreement between counts for animals up to 1 year old, and 54% agreement between those aged 2 years. Growth models The smallest and largest makos in the aged material were both males, measuring 90 cm (1 year old) and 299 cm FL (17 years old), respectively (Fig. 7). Exploratory trials revealed no con- sistent differences in the growth of males and females, irre- spective of model formulation (von Bertalanffy or Gompertz) and sex-pooled models were therefore preferred. Models in which L0 was constrained to 65 cm resulted in a bad fit of length data to ages 1–4 (the bulk of the data), and a low LN compared with the larger individuals observed in coastal samples. In these formulations, the VBM fitted the data significantly better than the GM (LRT; P, 0.001). Allowing the models to fit an unconstrained L0 resulted in unrealistically high estimates of L0 (109.0 cm) and LN (367 cm). The introduction of four neonates with assumed age of 0.1 year to the data resulted in the best fit to the sex-pooled VBM, even though the model was unable to provide an L0 estimate ,79 cm (lower bound). In these for- mulations the VBM fitted marginally better (lower AIC) than the GM, and it also fitted better than more complex VBM for- mulations with sex-dependent k and LN parameters. The sex- pooled VBM was therefore selected as the most realistic model of mako growth, and growth parameters (with 95% confidence intervals) were estimated to be 90.4 cm (79.6–101.0 cm) for L0, 285.4 cm (237.1–333.7 cm) for LN and 0.113 y �1 (0.058– 0.168 y �1 ) for k. The global uncertainty in the model, as denoted by its 95% confidence bands, is greater for older makos (right side of Fig. 7). However, it increases aswell for the length at birth (L0), a consequence of the inclusion of neonates in the material. 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 100 150 200 Fork length (cm) F re q u e n cy P r (m a tu re ) (a) (b) 250 300 0 20 40 0 20 40 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 100 150 200 250 300 0 15 30 0 15 30 Fig. 6.

Stomach contents The stomach contents of 840 makos were analysed; 292 of these were from the coastal dataset (Table 3) and 548 from the offshore dataset (Table 4). Of coastal samples, 107 stomachs (36.6%) were empty, and the remainder revealed 45 different types of prey item, of which 21 could be identified to species level, 21 to order or family, and three items (plastics, twine and terrestrial refuse) were of an anthropogenic origin. Elasmobranchs were the most common prey item in coastal samples (63.5%F and 72.8%W). Unidentified sharks of varying sizes contributed 36.5%F, followed by milk sharks Rhizoprionodon acutus (7.2%F) and dusky sharks Carcharhinus obscurus (5.0%F). Dusky sharks contributed 19.9%W, followed by spotted eagle- rays Aetobatus narinari (6.7%W). Spotted eaglerays comprised two large individuals, and therefore contributed only 1.1%F. Prey items that only occurred once (IRI, 2)were dogfish Squalus sp., blacktip Carcharhinus limbatus, smooth hammerhead Sphyrna zygaena and spotted ragged-tooth Carcharias taurus sharks. Teleosts contributed 43.1%F and 27.2%W in coastal sam- ples, and based on IRI they were less important (1036) than elasmobranchs (1184). Most teleosts could not be identified (29.8%F), and of 13 species that could be identified, spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonni was most common (2.8%F). Although cephalopods were common (25.5%N; 36.5%F), only the digestion-resistant beaks were usually present, and this may lead to an overestimate of their true importance in mako diet. Squid (Teuthida) were the most common cephalopod prey (16.0%F) and the third most frequent prey item. Table 3.

Cape horse mackerel Trachurus capensis was the most common prey (35.5%F), followed by unidentified teleosts (14.8%F), sardine Sardinops sagax (14.2%F) and squid Loligo spp. (13.6%F). Elasmobranchs were conspicuously absent from the offshore samples, with the exception of a single small mako (0.6%F) that was swallowed by a larger mako, presumably after being hooked on the longline. Discussion Clear spatial trends in mako size composition emerged from the GLM models used to analyse offshore and coastal data (see Fig. 4). The offshore model showed an increase in mean FL from west to east, with the smallest individuals occurring at the Agulhas Bank edge and larger ones upstream in the Agulhas Current, near the Mozambique border. Nearly all makos caught in offshore samples were juveniles with a FL of 90 cm and greater. Much larger makos were captured in coastal bather protection nets, and unlike those from the offshore samples, a large percentage of theseweremature and reproductively active. It is therefore hypothesised that mature makos move closer to the coast in eastern SouthAfrica, where some females give birth. Boat anglers have reported catches of neonates (,75 cm) sev- eral kilometres offshore of the central KZN coast, suggesting that pupping takes place in these shelf waters (Cliff et al. 1990). The above hypothesis assumes that the length distributions of catches made by longliners and bather protection nets were not biased by gear selectivity. No difference in length distributions of makos caught in shark-directed, compared with tuna- and sword- fish-directed vessels, could be found, despite the differences in longline configurations and depth intervals targeted. The sparsity of large makos in longline catches suggests that they are not abundant in offshore waters, or that the gear used do not retain large individuals long enough for them to be brought on board. A low abundance of large individuals in offshore waters appears to be the more likely explanation, because hooks directed at sharks and fittedwith a 50 cmsteel trace also failed to catch larger makos. Adult makos dive much deeper than juveniles (Sepulveda et al. 2004; Loefer et al. 2005), but hooks set in deeper strata (40–400m) for tuna did not catch more large specimens, suggesting that they are not abundant at greater depth. Length–frequency distributions of 14 shark species caught in the KZN bather protection nets showed little evidence of size selectivity (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). These multifila- ment nets caught a broad size range, from neonateCarcharhinus obscurus to adult Carcharodon carcharias, through entangling. The capture method differs from commercial monofilament gill-nets, which hook on the gills and select narrower size ranges (Kirkwood and Walker 1986; Simpfendorfer and Unsworth 1998). Makos caught in bather protection nets therefore proba- bly represent the size and sex distribution of the nearshore populations accurately, rather than biasing the data by selecting only larger specimens. The capture of mature females in bather protection nets, including five gravid females, confirms that some pupping occurs in coastal waters. However, these nets off eastern South Africa are restricted to a small area between Richards Bay (288480S) and Mzamba (318050S), and therefore no firm con- clusions can be drawn on the extent of coastal pupping grounds. Bustamante and Bennett (2013) similarly suggested the exis- tence of a coastal pupping and nursery area along the coast of northern Chile. The preponderance of juveniles at the Agulhas Bank edge suggests that it may be a juvenile feeding ground, and this is supported by high catch rates, compared with fishing grounds further east (Foulis 2013). Separate feeding grounds for juvenile makos were previously proposed for the NW Atlantic (Casey and Kohler 1992). A key assumption when using band pair counts in vertebrae to age makos was that band pairs are deposited annually. Although some uncertainty remains over band deposition rates, especially in young makos (Wells et al. 2013), the bulk of the evidence supports annual depositions. Radiocarbon methods (Campana et al. 2002; Natanson et al. 2006), marginal incre- ment analysis (Ribot-Carballal et al. 2005), and a mako injected with OTC off eastern South Africa (Natanson et al. 2006) have all suggested the deposition of a single band-pair per year. A second assumption was that the number of bands in vertebrae was independent of their exact place of excision along the vertebral column. Bishop et al. (2006) and Natanson et al. (2006) found no difference in mako band counts along the vertebral column. This finding is important in the present study, because post-cranial vertebrae as well as those from immedia- tely anterior to the first dorsal fin were used for counts. The pre- birth band visible in most vertebrae has been attributed to a change in embryonic diet, from internal yolk to eggs in lamnids (Branstetter and Musick 1994). Vertebral band widths were broader in smaller (younger) makos than in larger (older) specimens, where bands became narrower and compacted towards the periphery of the corpus calcareum. Band counts for larger makos were therefore pre- sumably less accurate than for smaller ones, causing underesti- mation of ages when the peripheral bands become too narrow to distinguish (Francis et al. 2007). Cerna and Licandeo (2009) also attributed the larger variation observed in the band counts of older makos to the difficulty of reading the bands, and to the smaller number of available samples.

C. Groeneveld et al. No consistent difference could be observed betweenmale and female growth rates, and therefore a sex-pooled VBM was selected to describe mako length-at-age. In contrast, several other studies have found that males grow faster than females (larger k), but do not become as large (smaller LN) (Pratt and Casey 1983; Bishop et al. 2006; Natanson et al. 2006; Cerna and Licandeo 2009; Semba et al. 2009).With the exception ofBishop et al. (2006) (Schnute growthmodel), the above studieswere also based on von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth models. The failure of our model to distinguish between male and female growth rates can probably be attributed to a relatively small sample size, few large adults in samples, and high variability of band counts, particularly in large individuals where bands became difficult to distinguish. The growth coefficient in the present study (k¼ 0.113 y�1) compared well with previous estimates of 0.087–0.125 y �1 in the NW Atlantic (Natanson et al. 2006), 0.076–0.087 y �1 in the SE Pacific (Cerna and Licandeo 2009) and 0.09–0.156 y �1 in the North Pacific (Semba et al. 2009). The LN estimate of 285m (sexes pooled) was close to the FL of the largest observedmako in this study (311 cm), and comparable to estimates from the NW Atlantic and Pacific (255–366 cm; Pratt and Casey 1983; Natanson et al. 2006; Cerna and Licandeo 2009; Semba et al. 2009). The overall uncertainty in our growth model is largest for the oldest makos, a poorly represented group in most studies of makos. Based on band counts, the oldest observed male mako was aged 19.5 years (267 cm FL) and the oldest female 18.5 years (249 cm). These counts most likely underestimate the real age of the specimens, because peripheral bands become too narrow to distinguish and count in older animals (Francis et al. 2007). Longevity in other regions has been estimated at 21–38 years in the NW Atlantic (Natanson et al. 2006) and 28–29 years in the Pacific (Bishop et al. 2006). Semba et al. (2009) counted a maximum of 14 annuli in a male mako of 264 cm FL and 20 in a female of 331 cm in the North Pacific. Pratt and Casey (1983) assumed biannual band pair deposition, and consequently reported decreased longevity (10–17 years) relative to studies that assumed annual deposition. Age validation of juvenile makos tagged and marked with OTC off southern California suggested rapid growth, with biannual deposition of growth bands in vertebrae for the first five years (Wells et al. 2013). Male makos reached maturity after 6.5–7 years and females after 13–13.5 years, and these estimates compared well with published values of 6–8 years and 15–20 years, respectively (Ribot-Carballal et al. 2005; Bishop et al. 2006; Natanson et al. 2006; Semba et al. 2009). Males reached maturity (L50) at 190 cm FL, slightly larger than estimates of 180–185 cm off New Zealand (Francis and Duffy 2005), 180 cm in the eastern North Atlantic (Maia et al. 2007), 179 cm off New South Wales (Stevens 1983) and 171 cm in the west and central Pacific (Semba et al. 2011). Females reached maturity at 250 cm FL, compared with 275–285 cm off New Zealand (Francis and Duffy 2005), 282 cm in the west and central Pacific (Semba et al. 2011) and 258 cm off New South Wales (Stevens 1983). Mollet et al. (2000) found that southern hemisphere females matured at 249 cm, compared with 272 cm in the western North Atlantic, but in combination, the above studies do not support a larger maturation size in northern than in southern waters, for either sex. The observed litter sizes (9–14) fall within the general range of 4–18 (Stevens 1983; Gilmore 1993). Mollet et al. (2000, 2002) reported a mean litter size of 12.5 pups, and a possible maximum of 25 to 30 pups. The mean FL of pups removed from the uteri of three gravid females in the current study (43.5, 47.0 and 51.8 cm) was well below the birth length of around 60 cm (Mollet et al. 2000), suggesting that they were in mid-term. Some 36.6% of makos caught in bather protection nets had empty stomachs, and this was similar to 40.9% reported for the same capture method and area for the period 1978–89 (Cliff et al. 1990). The percentage of empty mako stomachs was 31.6% in the NW Atlantic (Stillwell and Kohler 1982), and 32.9% off New SouthWales (Stevens 1984).Makos caught with longlines had empty stomachs in 69.8% of samples. A high percentage of empty stomachs is common among studies of sharks caught by longlines, and may be explained by ingestion of water and regurgitation of stomach contents while the shark attempts to free itself from the hook (Wetherbee et al. 1990; Vaske and Rincón 1998). Alternatively, sharks with full sto- machs may not take bait as frequently as those with empty stomachs, or prey may have been scarce in the sampled area. Makos in the present study preyed on teleosts (mainly T. capensis and S. sagax), elasmobranchs (R. acutus and C. obscurus) and cephalopods (Loligo sp.). Stevens (1984) found mainly teleosts in mako stomachs from Australia, and Maia et al. (2006) found mostly teleosts and cephalopods off Portugal. Jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, and Pacific saury, Cololabis saira, were important prey in the California Current (Preti et al. 2012) and in the NW Atlantic, 92%W comprised bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (Wood et al. 2009). Rogers et al. (2012) showed preliminary evidence of diet specialisation in makos, commensurate with other highly migratory species, despite relatively high prey diversity (Preti et al. 2012). In agreementwith Cliff et al. (1990), elasmobranchswere the most common prey of makos caught in bather protection nets in coastal waters (63.5%F; 72.8%W). We suggest that larger makos move closer to the coast because of increased food availability over the shelf compared with offshore waters. Presumably larger makos are able to manage larger prey items (Stillwell and Kohler 1982), and the most common prey in coastal waters in the present study was the milk shark,R. acutus, which attains lengths of 1m. Other relatively large and frequent prey itemswere the dusky shark,C. obscurus, a common coastal species with its nursery grounds in KZN waters (Dudley et al. 2005), spinner, C. brevipinna, and blackspot sharks, C. sealei. Makos caught offshore preyed mainly on much smaller pelagic teleosts, such as T. capensis and S. sagax. To conclude, mako populations in the SW IndianOceanwere demographically structured, with juveniles occurring mainly in offshore waters and larger, reproductively active adults appear- ing in coastal waters. The Agulhas Bank edge appears to be a feeding ground for juveniles during winter and spring. Growth rates and age-at-maturity appear to be lower than in the NW Atlantic and Pacific, but this result may have been influenced by the small number of large individuals available for ageing. Makos captured near the coast preyedmainly on elasmobranchs, whereas smaller makos fed on teleosts and cephalopods in offshore waters. These differences in diet may reflect the relative abundance of prey in the two environments, but prey Population structure and biology of shortfin mako Marine and Freshwater Research K size may also be a factor that attracts larger makos to coastal waters. The occurrence of gravid females in coastal samples suggests that some females pup in shelf waters in the SW Indian Ocean.
