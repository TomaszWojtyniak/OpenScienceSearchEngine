270615.qxd Abstract The results of published and unpublished ex- periments investigating the impacts of elevated [CO2] on the chemistry of leaf litter and decomposition of plant tissues are summarized. The data do not support the hy- pothesis that changes in leaf litter chemistry often asso- ciated with growing plants under elevated [CO2] have an impact on decomposition processes. A meta-analysis of data from naturally senesced leaves in field experiments showed that the nitrogen (N) concentration in leaf litter was 7.1% lower in elevated [CO2] compared to that in ambient [CO2]. This statistically significant difference was: (1) usually not significant in individual experi- ments, (2) much less than that often observed in green leaves, and (3) less in leaves with an N concentration in- dicative of complete N resorption. Under ideal condi- tions, the efficiency with which N is resorbed during leaf senescence was found not to be altered by CO2 enrich- ment, but other environmental influences on resorption inevitably increase the variability in litter N concentra- tion. Nevertheless, the small but consistent decline in leaf litter N concentration in many experiments, coupled with a 6.5% increase in lignin concentration, would be predicted to result in a slower decomposition rate in CO2-enriched litter. However, across the assembled data base, neither mass loss nor respiration rates from litter produced in elevated [CO2] showed any consistent pat- tern or differences from litter grown in ambient [CO2]. The effects of [CO2] on litter chemistry or decomposi- tion were usually smallest under experimental conditions similar to natural field conditions, including open-field exposure, plants free-rooted in the ground, and complete senescence. It is concluded that any changes in decom- position rates resulting from exposure of plants to elevat- ed [CO2] are small when compared to other potential impacts of elevated [CO2] on carbon and N cycling. Reasons for experimental differences are considered, and recommendations for the design and execution of decomposition experiments using materials from CO2- enrichment experiments are outlined. Keywords Decomposition · Elevated atmospheric CO2 · Lignin · Litter quality · Meta-analysis · Nitrogen Introduction There is ongoing debate about whether the increasing at- mospheric concentration of CO2 is resulting in increases in net terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) storage (Melillo et al. 1996). The average annual rate of increase of CO2 is 1.8 ppm, with a predicted doubling of pre-industrial concentrations by the end of the 21st century (Houghton et al. 1996). Despite an increasing number of studies on soil processes (see Canadell et al. 1996), little is known about the overall impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 on net ecosystem C storage (Amthor and Koch 1996). The suggestion that the rise in CO2 will lead to increases in plant biomass, and hence terrestrial C storage, is an over- simplification, since belowground C storage dominates in some terrestrial ecosystems (Anderson 1992). C storage in ecosystems (i.e., net ecosystem produc- tivity, NEP) is the difference between net primary pro- ductivity (NPP) and ecosystem heterotrophic respiration, both of which could change as atmospheric CO2 concen- trations ([CO2]) increase. Two general issues of concern are whether increases in NPP in response to rising CO2 R.J. Norby (✉) · E.G.

Both of these issues depend in part on whether the chemistry of plant-derived detrital material (litter) is different under elevated CO2. Changes in plant tissue chemistry may have important long-term ecosystem consequences. The rate at which litter decomposes has been related to its initial N concen- tration, lignin concentration, C:N ratio, and lignin:N ra- tio (Melillo et al. 1982). Decomposition rate, relative to the rate of litter production, is a determinant of ecosys- tem C sequestration. Decomposition is also a controller of N availability (see review by Marrs et al. 1983). Long-term ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 may ul- timately depend on N availability to plants and on the ability of plants to use N more efficiently under condi- tions of increased atmospheric CO2. The extent to which the C:N ratio of plant tissues can change is one of the key biogeochemical determinants regulating the amount of C that can be sequestered from the atmosphere into vegetation (Rastetter et al. 1992). The possibility that CO2 enrichment will alter the chemistry of litter such that decomposition is slowed and N availability reduced was first proposed by Strain and Bazzaz (1983). At that time there was evidence suggest- ing that the foliar N concentration was lower in CO2- enriched plants, so it was reasonable to assume that the N concentration in leaf litter would also be lower and its decomposition rate reduced. This, in turn, would result in lower N availability in the soil, providing a negative feedback to photosynthesis and plant growth. This sce- nario, called the “litter quality” hypothesis, has been fre- quently invoked to suggest that the increases in growth of plants observed in short-term experiments under ele- vated CO2 could not be sustained. Since the litter quality hypothesis was first proposed, a number of studies have evaluated the effect of elevated CO2 on litter chemistry or decomposition. The premise that green leaf tissue [N] is lower in elevated CO2 has been widely supported. Several compilations of the liter- ature have reported declines in foliar [N] in tree species averaging 21% (McGuire et al. 1995), 16% (Curtis and Wang 1998), 14% (Cotrufo et al. 1998a), or 13% (Norby et al. 1999). Much of this decline is related to an in- creased dry matter content of leaves rather than reduced total N content (Curtis 1996; Norby et al. 1999), but it is the N concentration (or C:N ratio) rather than total N content that is the more important expression of litter chemistry with regard to decomposition. The question remains, however, whether the [N] of leaves accurately predicts the [N] of litter or, indeed, its subsequent de- composition rate. Experimental results have been mixed, with some studies indicating a lower [N] in leaf litter in response to CO2 enrichment (reduced litter quality) (Cotrufo et al. 1994; Jongen et al. 1995; Van Ginkel et al. 1996), and others indicating no effect of CO2 (Gahrooee 1998; Hirschel et al. 1997; O’Neill and Norby 1996; Randlett et al. 1996). These different responses may be due to specific aspects of experimental design (e.g., nitrogen nutrition, light quality), the state of senes- cence of the plant materials used (O’Neill and Norby 1996), or factors influencing the process of senescence (Arp et al. 1997; Norby et al. 2000). The relationship between N in green leaves and N in litter is controlled by the process of resorption, which in- volves the breakdown of proteins during leaf senescence and amino acid translocation in the phloem to perennial tissue. Nitrogen resorption is a proximate controller of leaf litter [N], so any consideration of CO2 effects on lit- ter chemistry should explicitly consider CO2 effects on resorption (Norby et al. 2000). Although there is wide variation among species in resorption efficiency, or the fraction of green leaf N that is resorbed during senes- cence (Chapin and Kedrowski 1983), most ecosystem models set resorption efficiency as a constant, typically 50%, which is the average value across many species (Aerts 1996; Chapin and Kedrowski 1983). Changes in litter chemistry can be seen as a physio- logical response to elevated CO2, amenable to short-term experimental observation and with potentially important long-term implications (Norby et al. 1986). Experimental data on decomposition responses during short-term (sev- eral years at most) manipulations, however, are very dif- ficult to extrapolate through time, and ecosystem models are the best way to represent responses over realistic time scales (Thornley and Cannell 2000). Nevertheless, it is instructive to compare the predicted responses of de- composition to CO2 enrichment to actual experimental results. In so doing, we can better define the important research questions and refine the methods to be used in a new generation of longer-term studies. The experimental evidence on the decomposition of plant tissues grown in elevated [CO2] has been mixed, probably depending not only on plant culture and litter chemistry (Cotrufo et al. 1994; Van Ginkel et al. 1996), but also on the biological complexity of laboratory systems (Coûteaux et al. 1991; Schäppi and Körner 1997), and the length of the decom- position study (Ball and Drake 1997). A limited comparative analysis of elevated [CO2] on litter chemistry and decomposition processes was per- formed by O’Neill and Norby (1996), with the recogni- tion that certain aspects of experimental design and methods may compromise experimental outcome. Since the publication of that analysis, a considerable number of further investigations have been performed and reported, and both published and unpublished data have been col- lated for the synthesis presented here. Preliminary con- clusions from this synthesis have been presented (Norby and Cotrufo 1998), but the full data set and statistical an- alyses from which these conclusions were drawn have yet to be published; that is the purpose of the current review. Here we have used meta-analysis techniques (Curtis and Wang 1998; Gurevitch and Hedges 1993) to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 on litter chemis- try and decomposition, based on all relevant available data on the subject. We also reconsider the analysis pre- sented by Arp et al. (1997) on the effect of [CO2] on N 154 resorption to help explain some inconsistencies in the data sets. Finally, we use these analysis as a basis for dis- cussion of issues of experimental design and protocol, with a view toward future studies of decomposition and global change. Materials and methods Sources of data The synthesis originated from a workshop, “Litter Quality and De- composition under Elevated CO2” held in Capri, Italy, September 1998, under the auspices of Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosys- tems project (GCTE) and the European COST network (Norby and Cotrufo 1998). Data on litter chemistry and decomposition of plant tissue grown in elevated and ambient CO2 concentrations were gathered from participants of that workshop and from other published and pre-publication sources. The litter chemistry data base (Table 1) comprised observations of naturally senesced leaves of plants exposed to elevated CO2 (typically 600–700 ppm) in the field or in field chambers. Data from plants grown in growth chambers with artificial lighting were excluded because of the possible artifacts of unbalanced nutrition or abnormal senescence. Also excluded were data from non-senescent green leaves. The measures of litter chemistry were N concentration (mg g–1) and lignin concentration (mg g–1), with the number of replications and standard deviations included when available. The decomposition data base (Table 1) was less restrictive and included a wide range of plant tissue from different types of CO2-enrichment regimes and different protocols for measuring decomposition. The mea- sures of decomposition were percentage mass loss over time and the respiration rate of decomposing litter. Categorical variables Categorical variables describing characteristics of the source ma- terial, exposure protocol, and measurement protocol were defined, and observations were grouped into classes within these catego- ries. The procedures for exposing the plants to elevated [CO2] in- cluded open-top field chambers (OTC), solardomes (SD), growth cabinets (GC), or open-field exposure. The open-field class in- cluded free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE), screen-aided CO2 control (SACC), and natural CO2 springs (CS) (Table 1). The exposure protocol was also classified by whether the plants were in pots or soil boxes or free-rooted in the ground. The source material was classified as originating either from woody or herbaceous plants, and the plant part was leaf, wood, whole shoots, or roots. Leaves and herbaceous shoot tissue were classified as to whether they had senesced naturally, were standing dead, or were harvested prior to senescence; roots and twigs were always classified as harvested material. Other categories described whether the plant tissue used in decomposition experiments was intact, cut into pieces, or ground, whether it was air-dried or oven-dried; and whether the decomposition experiment was conducted in the laboratory or field. Statistical analysis The meta-data on leaf litter N and lignin concentrations and mass loss during decomposition were analyzed using MetaWin 2.0 soft- ware (Rosenberg et al. 2000). The procedure is analogous to the partitioning of variance in a classic ANOVA, enabling partitioning of variances in the comparisons of groups to within-class and be- tween-class homogeneity (see Curtis and Wang 1998). The effect size for each observation was calculated as the natural log of the response ratio (lnRR) (Hedges et al. 1999), where the response ra- tio is the mean in elevated [CO2] divided by the mean in ambient [CO2]. The mean effect size of a group is the weighted mean of in- dividual effect sizes, using the reciprocal of the standard deviation as the weight. Observations in which there was no standard devia- tion reported (as when n=1) were included conservatively by as- signing them the minimum weight calculated from other observa- tions in the data set, following the approach of Medlyn et al. (2001) and P.S. Curtis (personal communication). A mixed model was used, whereby it is assumed that studies within a class share a common mean effect, but there is also random variation among studies in a class, in addition to sampling variation (Gurevitch and Hedges 1993; Rosenberg et al. 2000). The significance of the dif- ference between class means was analyzed by the QB statistic, as- suming a χ2 distribution. The mean effect size of a class was con- sidered significant when the 95% confidence interval of the re- sponse ratio (after back conversion from the lnRR statistic) did not overlap 1. The effect of [CO2] on resorption of N from senescing leaves was analyzed with a data set assembled from CO2-enrichment ex- periments that reported both [N] in green leaves and [N] in leaf lit- ter after senescence. Resorption efficiency was calculated as the difference in green leaf and litter [N] divided by green leaf [N]. In most cases resorption efficiency was not explicitly measured in the original studies, and it was calculated from mean values, which precluded any estimate of variance. Only data from unfer- tilized, free-rooted trees and grasses that were grown in the open air or in field chambers were included in this analysis. Results N concentration in leaf litter N concentrations in naturally senesced leaves were re- duced when the plants were grown in elevated concen- trations of atmospheric CO2 in field experiments (Fig. 1a). The median of 67 experimental observations of N concentrations in leaf litter was 9.8 mg g–1 in ambient CO2 (range 2.9–31.0 mg g–1) and 9.2 mg g–1 in elevated CO2 (range 2.4–23.1 mg g–1). Meta-analysis of this data set indicated a significant effect of CO2 on litter [N] (Fig. 2). Based on analysis of the lnRR statistic, [N] was 7.1% lower in CO2-enriched litter. There were no signifi- cant differences in response between woody and herba- ceous plants, whether plants were free-rooted in the ground or in pots or soil boxes, or whether they were fer- tilized. There was, however, an effect (P=0.053) of ex- posure protocol (Fig. 2). The effect of CO2 on litter [N] was largest in SD experiments, and there was no signifi- cant effect in plants exposed in the open (SACC, FACE, and CO2 springs). The CO2 effect also was larger (P=0.049) when the control litter [N] was greater than 10 mg g–1, the level that Killingbeck (1996) sets as indi- cative of incomplete resorption. The slope of the regres- sion of lnRR on [N] was statistically significant (P=0.012), indicating an increasing effect of [CO2] with increasing [N]. Nitrogen resorption The average resorption efficiency from 20 observations in experiments with both grasses and tree species was 49% in ambient CO2 and 48% in high CO2 (not signifi- 155 156 Table 1 Sources of observations of effects of [CO2] on litter chemistry and decomposition.

Lignin concentration in leaf litter The N concentration decreased in litter with CO2 enrich- ment, whereas the lignin concentration tended to in- crease (Fig. 1b). The median of 46 experimental obser- vations of lignin concentrations in leaf litter was 138 mg g–1 in ambient CO2 (range 23–253 mg g–1) and 149 mg g–1 in elevated CO2 (range 26–287 mg g–1). Meta-analy- sis of the lignin data (lnRR statistic) indicated a signifi- cant effect of CO2 treatment, with a 6.5% increase in ele- vated CO2 (Fig. 4). There was a significant difference in response to CO2 between woody and herbaceous species (P=0.019), with CO2 enrichment increasing lignin con- centration in woody plants but not in herbaceous species (Fig. 4). The lignin concentration of leaf litter was not affected by [CO2] in plants planted in the ground or ex- posed in OTCs or in the open, but it increased in plants grown in pots or soil boxes or exposed in SDs. There was a confounding of effects among these categories: most of the observations in SDs were of woody plants growing in soil boxes or pots. There was no effect of [CO2] in litter in which [N] was less than 10 mg g–1 (Fig. 4). Mass loss of litter from ambient and elevated CO2 The percentage mass losses of litter produced at ambient or elevated CO2 across all the studies varied enormously (Fig. 5a). The wide range from 0.85 to 97.6% mass loss was not surprising given the large number of materials and experimental conditions being compared. Meta-anal- ysis indicated that there was no significant effect of [CO2] on mass loss during decomposition (Fig. 6). The only categorical variable with a significant effect was ex- posure protocol (P=0.007). CO2 enrichment significantly reduced decomposition (mass loss) when the plant tissue was grown in SDs but had no effect when the plants were exposed in other experimental facilities (Fig. 6). There were also significant CO2 effects on the decompo- sition of tissues from woody plants and from leaves, but the differences between classes of the plant type or plant part categories were not significant. Again, there was a confounding of the woody plant and leaf classes with the SD class, and when the SD data were not included, the response ratios of mass loss for the woody plant and leaf classes were not significantly different from 1. There were no other classes for which the response ratio was significantly different from 1. Litter decomposition – CO2 release There were many fewer observations of respiration rates of decomposing litters than of mass loss, and the data were reported in different units in different experiments so only the response ratios can be compared. There was no consistent effect of CO2 enrichment (Fig. 5b). There were not enough observations with error terms to permit meta-analysis. 157 Table 1 (continued) Reference Species Plant part Exposure Data bases system Hättenschwiler et al.

Although some in- dividual experiments have documented statistically sig- nificant declines in [N] in CO2-enriched leaf litter (e.g., Cotrufo and Ineson 1996; Cotrufo et al. 1994), very few experiments with plants rooted in the ground have done so, and O’Neill and Norby (1996) concluded that the re- sponses of litter chemistry of plants grown in pots or in growth chambers may be artifactual. In fact, because 158 Fig. 1a, b Litter chemistry of naturally senesced and abscised leaves of plants grown in field exposure systems with an elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration compared to equivalent plants grown in ambient CO2. a Nitrogen concentration; b lignin concen- tration.

The data compilation reported here is the first to be comprehensive, while excluding data that may not be representative of the responses of plants in the field. In most of the individual experiments included in the data base there was no statistically significant effect of CO2 on litter [N]. Nevertheless, mean litter [N] usually de- clined a small amount, and when the data sets were com- bined in a meta-analysis framework a significant effect was revealed. The 0.6 mg g–1 decline in [N] is much less than the 3.0 mg g–1 decline reported from the data set compiled by Côuteaux et al. (1999), which included green leaves, stems, and roots in addition to leaf litter. The decline just in leaf litter [N] (1.6 mg g–1) in their analysis was also much higher than that of our analysis. It is difficult to determine what was coded as litter in the Côuteaux et al. analysis, but it is clear that the data set included leaf material that did not senesce under field conditions or was picked off the plant before senescence was complete (e.g., Norby et al. 1986). Nitrogen resorption An unstated assumption of the “litter quality” hypothesis of Strain and Bazzaz (1983) is that the reduction in [N] commonly observed in the leaves of CO2-enriched plants would result in litters with associated reduced [N] and reduced decomposition. The 7.1% decline in leaf litter [N] caused by CO2 enrichment in our analysis is less than the decline reported for green leaves of plants in el- evated CO2, which for trees averages from 10 to 21%. The lower end of this range is from field-grown trees ex- posed to elevated CO2 for more than 2 years (Norby et al. 1999), whereas the higher end includes data from many short-term studies with tree seedlings in fertilized potting soil (McGuire et al. 1995). If plants grown in elevated CO2 have the same resorp- tion efficiency as plants in current ambient CO2, then 159 Fig. 4 Response ratio of leaf litter lignin concentration, presented as in Fig. 2 Fig. 5a, b Effect of CO2 concentration during growth on subsequent decomposition of plant tissue. a Relative mass loss of decomposing tissue after growth in ambient versus elevated CO2.

Sources of data are shown in Table 1. b Response ratio to growth [CO2] of CO2 release from decomposing litters any CO2 effect on foliar [N] should be reflected in the litter, as assumed in the “litter quality” hypothesis. The discrepancy between the CO2 effect on green leaves (from the literature) and the effect on litter reported here might indicate that resorption is less efficient in elevated [CO2]. Elevated CO2 could influence resorption by changing the ratio of soluble to structural N in a leaf (Arp et al. 1997), which is thought to be an important controller of resorption (Pugnaire and Chapin 1993). Arp et al. (1997) concluded that the resorption efficiency was reduced in elevated CO2, based on their summary of studies in which there were data on both green and se- nescent plant tissue. Resorption efficiency in ambient CO2 averaged 40% (range: 7–74%) but was reduced to 26% in high CO2. However, only one of the studies in- cluded in their analysis was a field study (Curtis et al. 1989), and there were several apparent artifacts in the other growth chamber studies that could have influenced N resorption (discussed in Norby et al. 2000). With more field data now available, we could conduct a similar analysis to that of Arp et al. (1997), but based only on studies with unfertilized plants free-rooted in the field or field chambers. This new analysis (Fig. 2) indicates that resorption efficiency should be similar in ambient and high CO2, and that CO2 effects on green leaf [N] should be reflected in leaf litter. Why then have most individual field CO2-enrichment experiments failed to detect an effect on litter [N]? The analysis of resorption in Acer rubrum and A. saccharum (Norby et al. 2000) provides some clues. There are sev- eral sources of variation in the resorption process that in- evitably increase the variance in litter [N] data compared to the variance in green leaves. Resorption involves changes not just in N, but in dry matter as well, and the resulting N concentration in litter is determined by changes in both N content and dry matter content. N concentrations of both green leaf and litter of the Acer species were lower in elevated CO2, but this was ex- plained completely by increased dry matter content – there were no differences in N content. This analysis was based on the [N] of individual, pre-selected leaves. Most analyses of litter quality, however, are based on bulk col- lections of all of the litter produced by a plant or group of plants – clearly a more ecologically relevant perspec- tive. Resorption efficiency is variable from leaf to leaf, especially if unpredictable events such as herbivory, storms, water stress, or early frost cause leaves to fall be- fore the resorption process is complete. Killingbeck (1996) argued that environmental influ- ences that prevent the fulfillment of potential resorption are the major cause of year-to-year variation in litter [N]. When [N] is greater than 10 mg g–1, resorption was prob- ably incomplete (Killingbeck 1996). In this synthesis of litter chemistry, the effects of CO2 were greater when [N] was higher and indicative of incomplete resorption. Incomplete resorption could result from an artifact of growth chamber conditions (e.g., Norby et al. 1986), pre- mature abscission by herbivores (B.G. Drake, personal communication), or unusual climatic events. In the first year of the experiment with the Acer species, the onset of leaf senescence was delayed in trees grown in elevat- ed temperatures in open-top field chambers (OTC) (Norby et al. 2000). When an early frost occurred, the still green leaves were killed, and they eventually absci- sed with significantly higher [N] than the leaves of trees in ambient temperature, which had completed resorption prior to the frost. The effects of elevated [CO2] on au- tumn phenology are less consistent than those of temper- ature, but this example of interrupted resorption illus- trates an important – and largely unpredictable – influ- ence on litter [N]. Ecosystem models that assume resorp- tion efficiency to be constant as CO2 rises and set litter [N] as a constant fraction of green leaf [N] (e.g., Comins and McMurtrie 1993) are consistent with experimental studies, but the necessary simplifications will miss much of the complexity of the real (and future) world. Litter lignin concentration Initial lignin concentrations in fresh, naturally senesced leaf litter was 6.5% (11 mg g–1) higher in response to el- evated [CO2], and the effect on lignin concentration oc- curred only in leaves of woody species. Although the re- sponse of the lignin-to-N ratio could not be calculated 160 Fig. 6 Response ratio of mass loss during decomposition, present- ed as in Fig. 2 from the separate means of lignin and N, the small in- crease in lignin coupled with a small decrease in [N] im- plies a somewhat larger increase in lignin-to-N ratio, a commonly used index of leaf litter decomposability (Melillo et al. 1982). The responses of N and lignin con- centrations to elevated [CO2] were not greatly influenced by experimental conditions (e.g., type of field exposure or fertilizer addition) as long as the data set was restrict- ed to observations of naturally senesced leaf litter that developed under field conditions. Decomposition The central role of both N and lignin in controlling litter decomposition rates (Fog 1988; Melillo et al. 1982; Taylor et al. 1989) suggests that any changes in these de- terminants of litter quality could lead to subsequent al- terations in litter decomposition rates. For example, a re- duction in [N] (with associated increase in C:N ratio) of litter within a species would be expected to result in a decrease in the rate of litter decomposition, regardless of the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Cotrufo et al. 1995). Lignin is particularly important in the later stages of de- composition, regulating litter mass loss rates (Berg and Staaf 1980; Berg et al. 1987). The degradation of lignin is accomplished by a limited group of soil micro-organ- isms, and it is known that high N levels may suppress lignin degradation rates through effects on these organ- isms (Berg and Ekbohm 1991). The reader is referred to the reviews of Fog (1988) and Cotrufo et al. (1998a) for a detailed description of these interactions, but it is clear that any decreases in litter [N] occurring under elevated [CO2] may well lead to an increase in lignin degradation in the final stages of decomposition. The overall, long- term outcome is, therefore, difficult to predict (Cotrufo et al. 1998a), but in a field study in which leaf litter was decomposed to nearly total mass loss, a reduction in de- composition rate attributable to elevated [CO2] was still evident at these very late stages (Cotrufo and Ineson 1996). The decrease in initial litter [N] and increase in initial lignin concentration revealed in this synthesis would pre- dict a slower decomposition rate. However, the experi- mental results show no single clear response, or even di- rection of response. This is especially noteworthy given that the data base may be biased toward showing a de- composition response because material from experi- ments in which leaf litter chemistry was found not to have changed may not have been used in subsequent de- composition experiments. The median values across all decomposition studies in the data base were 50.8% mass loss of ambient-derived tissue and 50.9% mass loss for CO2-enriched material. The compilation of data on CO2 release from decomposing litter also showed no consis- tent effect of [CO2]. The experimental conditions in which plants were grown, however, influenced subse- quent decomposition rates. The effects of elevated CO2 on N and lignin concentrations were largest in plants ex- posed in SDs, so it is perhaps not surprising that this ma- terial also showed the largest CO2 effect on decomposi- tion. Longer-term influences on decomposition If the overall conclusion from this synthesis is correct, namely that there is no consistent evidence for a negative effect of growth in elevated [CO2] on subsequent rates of litter mass loss, then what information is still needed? It is essential that the long-term decomposition responses be assessed since many questions remain concerning the extrapolation of short-term studies to long-term effects (Cotrufo et al. 1998a; Thornley and Cannell 2000). Un- detected or biologically insignificant differences in ini- tial litter chemistry (including constituents in addition to N and lignin) may propagate or amplify over the long term. Studies conducted over the course of months to a few years have been useful, but they fail to capture long- term dynamics, particularly with regard to lignin degra- dation, humification, and the ultimate fate of litter- derived C. Incubations are required that follow the course of decomposition over a decade, and even longer in the case of coniferous material and acidic soils, where litter accumulates and decomposes very slowly. The ex- periment of Latter et al. (1998) involving litter bag incu- bations over 23 years suggested that initial high rates of decomposition may lead to a residue with a higher frac- tion of stabilized material. Lower initial decomposition rates resulting from lower initial [N] may allow lignin to be more readily degraded in later stages; this is a crucial aspect when net ecosystem C storage is being modeled. From both a statistical and predictive viewpoint much information can be gained from examining inter-annual and inter-site variability in litter chemistry within spe- cies. Indications so far from a few species suggest that any response to elevated [CO2] is minimal compared to variability from year to year, soil to soil, and site to site. Berg et al. (1993) report changes in [N] in Scots pine needle litter over a 17-year study with annual variation of the order of 23%. Presumably, such changes are due to year-to-year variation in plant growth, resorption and soil N mineralization rates caused by inter-annual varia- tions in climate. The direct effects of temperature and moisture on the decomposition process are well docu- mented, yet little work has been done on the interactive effects of either of these factors with elevated CO2, and still less on interactions between CO2 and atmospheric pollutants such as ozone. For example, while CO2 en- richment alone may have only small effects on litter chemistry, physical damage from ozone exposure, com- bined with increased C fixation might result in more highly lignified litter (Boerner and Rebbeck 1995). Although an attempt has been made in the current synthesis to compare materials grown, and sometimes decomposed under both ambient and elevated [CO2], no studies have measured decomposition rates in soils that developed under elevated [CO2]. For example, new de- 161 composer communities might emerge after years of CO2 enrichment. Equilibration of ecosystems to higher [CO2] could result in soils with different moisture or physical conditions that would influence decomposition rates. In most studies it has been impractical to decompose litter in situ under elevated [CO2]; it may well be impossible to do it in soils that developed in a CO2-enriched atmo- sphere. The idea of changes in soils due to CO2 enrich- ment is one that should be examined further, possibly in ecosystems with rapid turnover times or in ecosystems exposed over time to natural sources of CO2 enrichment (e.g., CO2 springs). This analysis has considered how elevated [CO2] might alter the decomposition of individual plant tissues, but the potential long-term effects of [CO2] on plant community composition could have more profound in- fluences on ecosystem-wide decomposition and nutrient cycling (Pastor and Post 1988). If a long-term effect of rising atmospheric [CO2] or climatic change is a shift in community composition from species with low lignin:N litter to species with high lignin:N litter, the overall ef- fect on litter chemistry and decomposition at the commu- nity level could be much larger than the direct effect on an individual plant’s litter. Changes in the overall com- position of litter could also influence the decomposition of an individual leaf which is intimately connected with the litter and soil surrounding it (Chadwick et al. 1998). The input of N to the system, as well as the timing and rates of immobilization versus mineralization may change nutrient cycling rates and serve as either a posi- tive or a negative feedback on the system’s response to elevated [CO2]. Recommendations for standardizing measures of litter quality and decomposition in elevated-CO2 studies Synthesis of the effects of elevated CO2 or other global change factors on decomposition across a wide range of species and environmental conditions would be facilitat- ed if experimental and analytical methods were stan- dardized. For example, standardized assessment of ini- tial litter chemistry is critical, with, as a minimum, lig- nin and N concentrations as well as labile C being need- ed. Comparison litter data should also be obtained from plants of the same species grown under non-experimen- tal conditions in their natural habitat (O’Neill and Norby 1996). This may help to establish whether the litter chemistry of experimental controls are being compro- mised through experimental artifacts. Lack of such in- formation does not necessarily invalidate relative re- sponses to treatment (unless of course, the impact of the artifact is influenced by treatment) but does make it dif- ficult to judge whether the response can be extrapolated to the real world. Litter should be obtained from plants grown in the ground under natural conditions of water, light, and tem- perature (unless these conditions are part of the experi- mental manipulation). Litter produced under artificial culture conditions, while valid for use in some studies, results in data that are difficult to interpret when synthe- sis is attempted. Likewise, it is critical that foliar litter be naturally abscised and representative of a typical senes- cence period. In ecosystems where foliage persists over multiple growing seasons, it is recommended that only foliage that was both produced and abscised under treat- ment conditions be used. The microbial populations on the surface of plant tissue are important in initiating litter decomposition; hence, the plant material used in litter- bag studies should not be oven-dried, but used fresh or after minimal air-drying. For example, oven-drying at 50°C has been shown to reduce N concentrations and chemically increase lignin concentration in litter com- pared to air-drying at 25°C (Mafongoya et al. 1997). Likewise, it is recommended that litter should not be ground before measuring decomposition, as is standard for some laboratory methods. The effect of particle size on CO2 evolution and N mineralization-immobilization appears to differ with litter C-to-N ratios (Handayanto et al. 1997). Decomposition experiments should be conducted close to the origin of the litter (Bocock et al. 1960; Chadwick et al. 1998). Forest litter should decompose on forest soils, grass on grassland soil and so on, because decomposer communities may differ greatly between systems. Where practical, decomposition as well as litter production should occur under CO2 treatments, and re- ciprocal experiments should be done to control for both direct and indirect effects of CO2 enrichment, although direct effects of [CO2] can probably be considered insig- nificant (Ineson and Cotrufo 1997). With the emergence of large-scale experiments in a number of critical ecosystems, a unique opportunity has arisen for extended investigations into the process of long-term decomposition in a CO2-enriched world. Ap- propriate care toward experimental and analytical meth- ods will benefit future syntheses on the effects of atmo- spheric CO2 and other global change factors on litter chemistry and decomposition.
