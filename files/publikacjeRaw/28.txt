Introduction We consider the nonlinear Volterra sum-difference equations of nonconvolution type ∆(rn∆xn) = bn + n∑ k=1 K(n, k)f(xk), (E) where n ∈ N, rn, bn ∈ R, rn ̸= 0, f : R → R,K : N× N → R , N is a set of all positive integers, and R is the set of all real numbers. By a solution of (E) we mean a sequence of real numbers (xn) satisfying (E) eventually. We will use the following notation RN = {x : N → R}. If q ∈ N , Z ⊂ R , y ∈ RN , and α ∈ (0,∞) , then Nq = {q, q + 1, q + 2, . . . }, B(Z,α) = ⋃ z∈Z [z − α, z + α], B(y, q, α) = B(y(Nq), α). If x, y in RN , then xy : N → R, (xy)n = xnyn, ∥x∥ = sup{|xn| : n ∈ N}. ∗Corresponding: malgorzata.migda@put.poznan.pl 2010 AMS Mathematics Subject Classification: 39A10, 39A22 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. 2203 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math We also use the convention ∑j i=k aj = 0 whenever j < k . If r is a real sequence such that rn ̸= 0 for any n , then we define the sequence r∗ ∈ RN by r∗n = n−1∑ i=1 1 ri . (1) Discrete Volterra equations appeared as a discretization of Volterra integral and integro-differential equations. They also often occur during the mathematical modelling of some real life situations because they describe processes whose current state is determined by the whole previous history. The first order discrete Volterra equation are usually represented in the form x(n+ 1)− x(n) = n∑ k=1 A(n, k)f (k, x(k)) + g(n). Asymptotic behavior of solutions of equations of this type has been studied by many authors, i.e. in [1– 13, 15, 22, 23]. To the best of our knowledge, there are a few papers dealing with the asymptotic behavior of solutions of higher order discrete Volterra equations, see [14, 17–19]. Note that the difference equation ∆(rn∆xn) = anf(xn) + bn (2) is a special case of (E). Indeed, if K(n, k) = 0 for all k ̸= n , and if we take an = K(n, n) , then equation (E) takes the form (2). For the results on asymptotic properties of equations of type (2) we refer, for example, to [20, 25–28]. The purpose of this paper is to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution x of equation (E) with the property xn = yn + o(ns), where y is a given solution of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn and s ∈ (−∞, 0] . We also obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of asymptotically periodic solutions of equation (E). The presented results generalized some of the results obtained in [19, 20]. 2. Main results In this section, in Theorems 1 and 2, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution x of equation (E) having the property xn = yn + o(n s), where y is a given solution of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn and s ∈ (−∞, 0] . Moreover, in Theorem 3, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution x of equation (E) with the asymptotic property xn = cr ∗ n + d+ o(n s), where c, d are real constants. We will use the following, easy to prove, remark. Remark 1 A sequence y is a solution of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn if and only if there exist real constants c, d such that yn = n−1∑ j=1 1 rj j−1∑ i=1 bi + c n−1∑ j=1 1 rj + d for any n . 2204 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Moreover, in the proofs of our results we will use three lemmas, which we present below. Lemma 1 [19, Lemma 1] Assume that u ∈ RN , n ∈ N , and ∞∑ j=1 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j |ui| < ∞. Then ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j |ui| ≤ ∞∑ j=n j∑ i=1 |uj | |ri| < ∞. The proof of the following lemma we leave to the reader. Lemma 2 If β is a nonnegative sequence, then ∑∞ n=1 nβn = ∑∞ n=1 ∑∞ k=n βk . Lemma 3 If s ∈ (−∞, 0] and ∑∞ j=1 1 js|rj | ∑∞ k=j ∑k i=1 |K(k, i)| < ∞ , then ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j i∑ k=1 |K(i, k)| = o(ns). Proof For n ∈ N let ηn = ∞∑ j=n 1 js|rj | ∞∑ k=j k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)|, λn = ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j i∑ k=1 |K(i, k)|. By assumption, ηn = o(1) . Moreover, λn ns = 1 ns ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j i∑ k=1 |K(i, k)| ≤ ηn = o(1). Hence, λn = o(ns) . 2 We will also apply a fixed point lemma of the form. Lemma 4 [16, Lemma 4.7] Let y be a real sequence and let ρ be a positive sequence, which converges to zero. Define a metric d on the set X = {x ∈ RN : |xn − yn| ≤ ρn, for any n ∈ N} by d(x, z) = ∥x− z∥ . Then any continuous map H : X → X has a fixed point. Theorem 1 Assume that s ∈ (−∞, 0] , t ∈ [s,∞) , q ∈ N , α,L,Q ∈ (0,∞) , ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞, y ∈ RN, ∆(rn∆yn) = bn, (3) 2205 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math |f(u)| ≤ L for u ∈ B(y, q, α), 1 |rn| ≤ Qnt for any n, (4) and f is continuous on B(y, q, α) . Then there exists a solution x of (E) possessing the property xn = yn + o(n s). (5) Proof For a sequence x : N → R we define a sequence x̂ by x̂n = n∑ k=1 K(n, k)f(xk). (6) Let us denote Y = {x ∈ RN : |xn − yn| ≤ α for any n ∈ N}. We define a sequence θ by θn = n∑ k=1 |K(n, k)|. Then, using Lemma 2, we get ∞∑ n=1 1 ns|rn| ∞∑ j=n θj ≤ Q ∞∑ n=1 nt−s ∞∑ j=n θj ≤ Q ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ j=n jt−sθj = Q ∞∑ n=1 nnt−sθn = Q ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ k=1 |K(n, k)|. Hence, by our assumptions, we obtain ∞∑ n=1 1 ns|rn| ∞∑ j=n θj < ∞, ∞∑ j=1 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j θi < ∞. (7) Now, we define a real sequence ρ by ρn = L ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j θi. (8) By Lemma 3, we have ρn = o(ns) . Hence, there exists an index p ≥ q such that ρn ≤ α (9) for n ≥ p . Next, we introduce a subset X of RN X = {x ∈ RN : |xn − yn| ≤ ρ for n ≥ p and xn = yn for n < p} and we define a mapping H as follows H : Y → RN, H(x)(n) = { yn for n < p yn + ∑∞ j=n 1 rj ∑∞ i=j x̂i for n ≥ p. 2206 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Note that X ⊂ Y . Let x ∈ X . By (4), |f(xi)| ≤ L for i ≥ p . Using (6) and (8) we obtain |H(x)(n)− yn| = ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j x̂i ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j |x̂i| ≤ ρn for n ≥ p . Therefore, HX ⊂ X . Now we show that the mapping H is continuous with respect to the metric defined in Lemma 4. By Lemma 1 and (7), we have ∞∑ n=1 n∑ j=1 1 |rj | θn < ∞. Let ε > 0 . There exists an index m such that m ≥ p and L ∞∑ n=m n∑ j=1 1 |rj | θn < ε. (10) Moreover, there exists a positive constant γ such that γ m∑ n=1 n∑ j=1 1 |rj | θn < ε. (11) Let B = B({y1, y2, . . . , ym}, α). Since f is uniformly continuous on B , there exists a positive δ such that if t1, t2 ∈ B and |t1 − t2| < δ , then |f(t1)− f(t2)| < γ. (12) Let us take z ∈ X such that ∥x− z∥ < δ . Then, we have ∥Hx−Hz∥ = sup n≥p ∣∣∣∣∣ ∞∑j=n 1rj ∞∑ i=j (x̂i − ẑi) ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ sup n≥p ∞∑ j=n 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j |x̂i − ẑi| = ∑∞ j=p 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j |x̂i − ẑi| ≤ ∞∑ j=p 1 |rj | ∞∑ i=j i∑ k=1 |K(i, k)||f(xk)− f(zk)|. Hence, using Lemma 1, we get ∥Hx−Hz∥ ≤ ∞∑ j=p j∑ i=1 1 |ri| j∑ k=1 |K(j, k)||f(xk)− f(zk)|. 2207 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Remark that by (4) |f(xj)− f(zj)| ≤ 2L for j ≥ p , and, by (12), |f(xj)− f(zj)| ≤ γ for j ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,m}. Hence, using (10) and (11), we obtain ∥Hx−Hz∥ ≤ γ m∑ n=1 n∑ j=1 1 |rj | θn + 2L ∞∑ n=m n∑ j=1 1 |rj | θn < 3ε. This proves the continuity of H on X . By Lemma 4 there exists a point x ∈ X such that x = Hx . Then, for n ≥ p , we have xn = yn + ∞∑ j=n 1 rj ∞∑ i=j x̂i. Hence, for n ≥ p , we get ∆(rn∆xn) = ∆(rn∆yn) + ∆ ( rn∆ ( ∞∑ j=n 1 rj ∞∑ i=j x̂i )) = bn −∆ ( rn 1 rn ∞∑ i=n x̂i ) = bn + x̂n = bn + n∑ k=1 K(n, k)f(xk). This means that x is a solution of equation (E). Since x ∈ X and ρn = o(ns) we have xn−yn = o(ns) . Hence, xn = yn + o(n s) . 2 The following corollary shows, that Theorem 1 extends [19, Theorem 3.1]. Corollary 1 Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] , t ∈ [s,∞) , c, d ∈ R , q ∈ N , α ∈ (0,∞) , r−1n = O(n t), ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞, ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s|bn| < ∞, and f is continuous and bounded on B(cr∗ + d, q, α) . Then there exists a solution x of (E) possessing the property xn = cr ∗ n + d+ o(n s). Proof Choose a number α′ ∈ (0, α) . Define sequences v, y′ by vn = ∞∑ j=n 1 rj ∞∑ i=j bi, y ′ n = cr ∗ n + d+ vn. It is easy to see that vn = o(ns) . There exists an index q′ ≥ q such that |vn| ≤ α− α′ for any n ≥ q′ . Then B(y′, q′, α′) ⊂ B(cr∗ + d, q, α). 2208 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Hence, f is continuous and bounded on B(y′, q′, α′) . Moreover, by Remark 1, we have ∆(rn∆(cr∗n + d)) = 0 and ∆(rn∆vn) = bn . Therefore, ∆(rn∆y′n) = bn . By Theorem 1, there exists a solution x of (E) such that xn = y ′ n + o(n s) . Then xn = cr ∗ n + d+ vn + o(n s) = cr∗n + d+ o(n s). 2 Note that if, in Corollary 1, we assume that rn > 0 , then we obtain [19, Theorem 3.1]. Corollary 2 Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] , t ∈ [s,∞) , y : N → R is bounded, r−1n = O(n t), ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞, ∆(rn∆yn) = bn, and f is continuous. Then there exists a solution x of (E) possessing the property xn = yn + o(n s). Proof The function f is continuous and bounded on the set B(y, 1, 1) . Hence, the result follows from Theorem 1. 2 Corollary 3 Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] , t ∈ [s,∞) , y : N → R is bounded below, r−1n = O(n t), ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞, ∆(rn∆yn) = bn, and f is continuous on R and bounded at infinity. Then there exists a solution x of (E) possessing the property xn = yn + o(n s) . Proof There exists a real constant λ such that B(y, 1, 1) ⊂ [λ,∞). The function f is continuous and bounded on [λ,∞) . Hence, the result follows from Theorem 1. 2 Corollary 4 Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] , t ∈ [s,∞) , r−1n = O(n t), ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞, and f is continuous and bounded. Then for any solution y of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn there exists a solution x of (E) possessing the property xn = yn + o(n s). Proof The assertion is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1. 2 In the next theorem, we also give sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution x of equation (E) with the property (5), but the assumption for the kernel K(i, n) is weaker than in Theorem 1. However, we must assume the boundedness of the sequence r∗ . The method of proof is analogous, but we use another operator H . This theorem generalized Theorem 2.2 from paper [20]. 2209 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Theorem 2 Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] , f is continuous, r∗ is bounded, and ∞∑ n=1 1 ns n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞. (13) Then for any bounded solution y of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn there exists a solution x of (E) possessing the property xn = yn + o(ns) . Proof Assume y is a bounded solution of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn . For n ∈ N and x : N → R let x̂n = n∑ k=1 K(n, k)f(xk). (14) Let C be a compact subset of R such that B(y, 1, 1) ⊂ C. There exists a constant L > 0 , such that |f(t)| ≤ L for any t ∈ C . Since s ≤ 0 we have ∞∑ k=1 k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| < ∞. (15) Now, we define a number R and a subset Y of RN by R = ∥r∗∥ , Y = {x ∈ RN : |x − y| ≤ 1} . Moreover, we define a sequence ρ by ρn = 2RL ∞∑ k=n k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)|. Since s ≤ 0 , we get ρn ns = 2RL ∞∑ k=n 1 ns k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| ≤ 2RL ∞∑ k=n 1 ks k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)|. By (13) we obtain ∞∑ k=n 1 ks k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| = o(1), which means that ρn = o(ns) . Therefore, there exists an index p ∈ N for which ρn ≤ 1 for n ≥ p . Let X = {x ∈ RN : |xn − yn| ≤ ρ for n ≥ p and xn = yn for n < p}. (16) Then X ⊂ Y . For any x ∈ Y and any n ∈ N we have xn ∈ C . Therefore, |f(xn)| ≤ L (17) for any n ∈ N . Now, we define an operator H : Y → RN by H(x)(n) = { yn for n < p yn + ∑∞ k=n x̂k ∑k i=n 1 ri for n ≥ p. (18) 2210 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Remark that ∣∣∣∣∣ k∑ i=n 1 ri ∣∣∣∣∣ = |r∗k+1 − r∗n| ≤ |r∗k+1|+ |r∗n| ≤ 2R. (19) Let x ∈ X and n ≥ p . Then, using (19), we get |H(x)(n)− yn| ≤ ∞∑ k=n |x̂k| ∣∣∣∣∣ k∑ i=n 1 ri ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ 2R ∞∑ k=n ∣∣∣∣∣ k∑ i=1 K(k, i)f(xi) ∣∣∣∣∣ . Hence, |H(x)(n)− yn| ≤ 2RL ∞∑ k=n k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| = ρn and we obtain that HX ⊂ X . Next, we show the continuity of H . Let x ∈ X and ε > 0 . By (15) there is an index m ≥ p such that L ∞∑ k=m k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| < ε. (20) Moreover, there exists a positive constant γ such that γ m∑ k=1 k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| < ε. (21) Since f is uniformly continuous on C there exists a positive number δ such that if t1, t2 ∈ C and |t1− t2| < δ , then |f(t1)− f(t2)| < γ. (22) Let us take z ∈ X such that ∥x− z∥ < δ . By (19), we have ∥Hx−Hz∥ = sup n≥p ∞∑ k=n |x̂k − ẑk| ∣∣∣∣∣ k∑ i=n 1 ri ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ 2R ∞∑ k=p |x̂k − ẑk|. Hence, by (14), we get ∥Hx−Hz∥ ≤ 2R ∞∑ k=p k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)||f(xi)− f(zi)|. Using (22) and (17) we get ∥Hx−Hz∥ ≤ 2Rγ m∑ k=1 k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)|+ 4RL ∞∑ k=m k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)|. Therefore, by (21) and (20), ∥Hx − Hz∥ < 6Rε . This means that the map H : X → X is continuous with respect to the metric defined in Lemma 4. By Lemma 4 there exists a fixed point of H . Denote this fixed point by x . From the definition of H we have xn = yn + ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri (23) 2211 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math for n ≥ p . By (23), for n ≥ p we get ∆(rn∆xn) = bn +∆ ( rn∆ ( ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri )) . (24) Moreover, ∆ ( ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri ) = ∞∑ k=n+1 x̂k k∑ i=n+1 1 ri − ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri = ∞∑ k=n+1 x̂k k∑ i=n+1 1 ri − ∞∑ k=n x̂k ( 1 rn + k∑ i=n+1 1 ri ) = ∞∑ k=n+1 x̂k k∑ i=n+1 1 ri − 1 rn ∞∑ k=n x̂k − ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n+1 1 ri . Hence, ∆ ( ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri ) = − 1 rn ∞∑ k=n x̂k − x̂n n∑ i=n+1 1 ri = − 1 rn ∞∑ k=n x̂k. for n ≥ p . Therefore, ∆ ( rn∆ ( ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri )) = −∆ ( ∞∑ k=n x̂k ) = x̂n (25) for n ≥ p . Thus, by (24), (25) and (14), x is a solution of (E). Since x ∈ X and ρn = o(ns) , we have xn = yn + o(n s). 2 Remark 2 If the sequence r∗ is bounded, then by Remark 1, the existence of a bounded solution of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn is equivalent to the boundedness of the sequence un = n−1∑ j=1 1 rj j−1∑ i=1 bi. (26) Moreover, if the sequence (26) is bounded, then any solution y of the equation ∆(rn∆yn) = bn is bounded. Below, in our last theorem, we present sufficient conditions under which for any real constants c, d equation (E) possesses solution x with the property xn = cr∗n + d+ o(ns) . Theorem 3 Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] , the function f is continuous, the sequence r∗ is bounded, ∞∑ n=1 1 ns n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞, and ∞∑ n=1 |bn| ns < ∞. (27) Then for any real constants c, d there exists a solution x of equation (E) possessing the property xn = cr ∗ n + d+ o(n s). 2212 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Proof Assume c, d ∈ R . Define a sequence y by yn = cr∗n + d . It is easy to see that ∆(rn∆yn) = 0 for any n . For n ∈ N and x : N → R let x̂n = bn + n∑ k=1 K(n, k)f(xk). Since y is bounded, there is a compact subset C of R such that B(y, 1, 1) ⊂ C. Since f is continuous, there exists a positive constant L , such that |f(t)| ≤ L for any t ∈ C . We denote R = ∥r∗∥ , Y = {x ∈ RN : |x− y| ≤ 1} , and define a sequence ρ by the formula ρn = 2R ∞∑ k=n ( |bk|+ L k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| ) . Similarly as in the proof of Theorem 2, we obtain ∞∑ k=n k∑ i=1 |K(k, i)| = o(ns). It is easy to see that ∞∑ k=n |bk| = o(ns). Hence, ρn = o(ns) . Therefore, there exists an index p ∈ N such that ρn ≤ 1 for n ≥ p . Define a subset X of RN by (16), and an operator H : Y → RN by (18). Just like in the proof of Theorem 2, we can show that there exists a point x ∈ X such that Hx = x . Then for n ≥ p we have xn = yn + ∞∑ k=n x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri . Hence, ∆(rn∆xn) = ∆(rn∆yn) + ∆ ( x̂k k∑ i=n 1 ri ) = 0 + x̂n = bn + n∑ k=1 K(n, k)f(xk) for n ≥ p . Therefore, x is a solution of (E). Moreover, since x ∈ X we get xn = yn + o(n s) = cr∗n + d+ o(n s). 2 If, in Theorem 3, we assume that the sequence r∗ is ω -periodic, then we get the following criterion for the existence of asymptotically periodic solutions of equation (E). 2213 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Corollary 5 Assume s ∈ (−∞, 0] , ω ∈ N , f is continuous, r∗ is ω -periodic, ∞∑ n=1 1 ns n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| < ∞ and ∞∑ n=1 |bn| ns < ∞. Then equation (E) has asymptotically ω -periodic solution of the form xn = cr∗n + d+ o(ns) where c, d ∈ R . Proof This corollary follows directly from Theorem 3. 2 As we noted in the Introduction, if K(n, k) = 0 for k ̸= n , denoting an = K(n, n) equation (E) takes the form (2). Therefore, Theorem 3 generalizes [20, Theorem 2.1]. 3. Examples In this section we present some examples to illustrate the obtained results. Example 1 Let s = 0, t = 1 , rn = 1n+2 , K(n, k) = 1 n4k2 , f(x) = 1 x for x ̸= 0 and bn = 3(n+3)4 − 1 (n+1)n3 . Then equation (E) takes the form ∆ ( 1 n+ 2 ∆xn ) = 3 (n+ 3)4 − 1 (n+ 1)n3 + n∑ k=1 1 n4k2 1 xk (28) for x ̸= 0 and we have r−1n = O(nt) . Let c = 0, d = 1 . Then cr∗ + d = 1 . Let q = 1 , α = 1 2 , then B(cr∗ + d, q, α) = ∞⋃ n=1 [ 1− 1 2 , 1 + 1 2 ] = [ 1 2 , 3 2 ] . Hence, f is bounded and continuous on B(cr∗ + d, q, α) . It is easy to check that ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s|b(n)| = ∞∑ n=1 n2 ∣∣∣∣ 3(n+ 3)4 − 1(n+ 1)n4 ∣∣∣∣ < ∞ and ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| = ∞∑ n=1 n2 n∑ k=1 1 n4k2 = ∞∑ n=1 1 n2 n∑ k=1 1 k2 < ∞. Hence, by Corollary 1, there exists a solution x of (28) such that xn = cr∗ + d + o(1) . Indeed the sequence xn = 1 + 1 n is a solutions of (28) with such property. Example 2 Let f be a continuous function, s ∈ (−1, 0] . For n ∈ N let rn = n 2, bn = −2n2 cos nπ 2 − (2n+ 1) ( sin nπ 2 − cos nπ 2 ) , K(n, k) = k n4 . Then equation (E) takes the form ∆ ( n2∆xn ) = −2n2 cos nπ 2 − (2n+ 1) ( sin nπ 2 − cos nπ 2 ) + n∑ i=1 k n5 f(xk). (29) 2214 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math The sequence r∗n = ∑n−1 k=1 1 k2 is bounded, the sequence yn = sin nπ2 is a 4-periodic solution of the equation ∆(n2∆yn) = −2n2 cos nπ 2 − (2n+ 1) ( sin nπ 2 − cos nπ 2 ) . Moreover, we have ∞∑ n=1 1 ns n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| = ∞∑ n=1 1 ns+4 n∑ i=1 k = ∞∑ n=1 n+ 1 2ns+3 < ∞. Thus, all assumptions of Theorem 2 are satisfied. Hence, equation (29) has asymptotically 4-periodic solution of the form xn = sin nπ 2 + o(ns). In the next two examples we show that Theorem 1 is independent of Theorem 2. Example 3 Let rn = 1n , K(n, k) = 2k n6 , f is a continuous function. Then equation (E) takes the form ∆ ( 1 n ∆xn ) = bn + n∑ k=1 2k n6 f(xk). (30) Let b be a sequence of real numbers such that ∑∞ n=1 n ∑n−1 i=1 bi < ∞ . Then, by Remark 1, there exists a bounded solution of equation ∆ ( 1 n ∆yn ) = bn. Let us take s ∈ (−1, 0] , t = 1 . Then we have r−1n = O(nt) and ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| = ∞∑ n=1 n2−s n∑ k=1 2k n6 = ∞∑ n=1 n+ 1 n3+s < ∞. By Theorem 1, there exists a solution x of (30) such that xn = yn + o(ns) . Let us remark, that the sequence r∗n = ∑n−1 k=1 k is unbounded. Hence, Theorem 2 can not be applied to (30). Example 4 Let rn = n2 , K(n, k) = 2kn4 , f is a continuous function, b is a sequence of real numbers such that ∞∑ n=1 1 n2 n−1∑ i=1 bi < ∞. Then equation (E) takes the form ∆ ( n2∆xn ) = bn + n∑ k=1 2k n4 f(xk). (31) Let s ∈ (−1, 0] . Then we have ∞∑ n=1 1 ns n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| = ∞∑ n=1 1 ns n∑ k=1 2k n4 = ∞∑ n=1 n+ 1 n3+s < ∞. 2215 MIGDA and DUTKIEWICZ/Turk J Math Moreover, by Remark 1, all solutions of the equation ∆(n2∆yn) = bn are bounded. Hence, by Theorem 2, for any solution y of the equation ∆(n2∆yn) = bn there exists a solution x of (31) such that xn = yn + o(ns) . Note, that for t ≥ s we have ∞∑ n=1 n1+t−s n∑ i=1 |K(n, i)| ≥ ∞∑ n=1 n n∑ k=1 2k n4 = ∞∑ n=1 n+ 1 n2 = ∞. Hence, Theorem 1 cannot be applied to (31).
